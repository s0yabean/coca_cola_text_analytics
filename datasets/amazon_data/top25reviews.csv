These ""pony"" bottles are perfectly sized as a quick refresher that will still be cold by the time you empty it. If you have kids in the household, this size is a  treat for them without being a soda overload. At a party, guests can grab one of these for a pick-me-up without having to hang onto a larger bottle for another half hour.<br /><br />Price per ounce on these is higher than the popular 16.9 ounce bottle (which also seems to frequently be on sale in local stores), but it's still pretty reasonable---particularly if with the larger bottles you find yourself pouring out half-finished remains very frequently. Convenient and cute!",4

I searched for &#34;Coke Zero makes me itch&#34; and found a number of hits that suggest that the culprit is Aspartame and that allergies to it are not uncommon.  One comment even went so far as saying that Aspartame has no place in the human diet.  (IMHO, it's probably not so great for animals, either.  :-)  )<br /><br />Second, I have never seen a 7.5 oz can before, and while it's my fault that I didn't pay attention, you should note that these cans are smaller than what you are probably used to.  You can't tell the size from the picture.<br /><br />Third, the expiration date is only a few months off.<br /><br />Finally, the cans came loose easily from the plastic ring set (which I though were no longer used due to harming animals) and crushed some of the other products in my Pantry box.<br /><br />All-in-all, I was somewhat disappointed, even at this price I paid.",2

I ordered these Coca-Cola Mini-Cans (8 Count), 7.5 Fl. oz. each. I believed that this order was the 8 Fl. oz. (8 count) at the time of my order.<br /><br />When we received these mini cans; they are really smaller, and it is very noticeable.  Based on my oversight at the time of my order, the realization hit me when I received this 8 count mini-can set products. I also realized that we were losing ounces equal to the 8 Fl. Oz can.<br />We all enjoyed them, yet noticed that the amount of sips that we are accustomed to was less, so my family members kept teasing me throughout the entire time we were using this product.  Since we love Coca-Cola in our household, we enjoyed them, although we have noticed a few sips less.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to others, and Amazon Customers. Coca-Cola has the same great taste, a great drink to have with snacks, meals, or on the go, if you like sodas. This is a perfect size for people who do not usually want an 8 Fl. oz can of soda, and would like a mini-size.  The Seller was accurate in their description of this product, delivery and packaging timely. I think it is fascinating how this soft drink was created in 1886 in Atlanta, Georgia by John S. Pemberton, offered as a fountain beverage at Jacobs Pharmacy by mixing Coca-Cola syrup with carbonated water.",5

I for one really don't care as I really don't drink that much soda.  If you look at the lab tests for the HFS and HFCS you will have to note that an amount which exceeds 100,000 times the yearly average human intake was administered to get cancers or diseases to develop in the test subject.  So basically if you don't  consume soda in truly massive quantities you will never have to worry about the claims of cancer or strange disease association.<br /><br />I do like the 'throwback' soda though - the real sugar taste is more to my liking and its not near as sweet as most American produced soda is now.

The only thing that does concern me a little is that these contain aspartame as the sweetener and there is some question about how safe that is.  With the exception of stevia, probably none of the artificial sweeteners are good for us, but if you are going to drink a diet or zero calorie soda anyway, this is one of the best tasting in my opinion.

I like Pepsi too and dont really have a preference between the two. Im not even sure I could tell the two apart but anyways, Coke is tasty and comforting.

The 8 oz. can is nice for forcing you to drink less of it, thereby cutting a few calories. The smaller can is also more handy and portable. For example, it fits nicely into the pocket of a cycling jersey. Yes even warm Coke tastes pretty good. The smaller can might also reduce some of the guilt you get for drinking Coke because theres no denying thats its bad for you.

Plus it's kind of expensive too, if you can't find it on sale. Out of the major brands, I will take Coke Zero every time. In fact, I almost never drink regular Diet Coke ever since Zero came out. The taste is much better, attempting to more closely mirror Coke Classic (something that Diet Coke doesn't actually aim for, it has always been a different - and in my opinion - not very good flavor). The old, discontinued Pepsi One was actually the best ever, but it's long gone. Like many people, I am leery about the chemicals in this drink but I don't sweat it too much under moderate consumption.<br /><br />As for the mini-cans, eh - they're okay I guess. I prefer a standard 12 oz can ultimately. But I don't fault the product itself simply because it's been offered in a smaller container. If you want to try limiting your intake of soda, it's possible the smaller can will do the trick - especially if you take on the road or bring it to work, school, etc. But at home, if you're anything like me, you might just find yourself reaching for a second one - in which case you'd be better off opting for the full-size cans.",5

Using the current retail prices (Publix in SC) the two liter container at $1.99 each gives you the lowest price, $0.029 per oz..  The half-liter bottles, sold six for $3.99 gives you a price of $0.039 per oz.  The twelve pack of twelve oz. cans at $5.99 results in a price of $0.042 cents per oz.  And the Diet Coke Mini-Cans sold as eight for $3.99 gives a price per oz. of $0.067 (the highest price per oz.)<br /><br />I do not see the market for this small size can, due to its higher price per oz.  Maybe there is a convenience factor, if one has lots of small children, but then the two liter bottle seems to fill the bill, unless the children are getting the cans themselves and cannot be trusted to fill a glass from the two liter size.<br /><br />Only if you have some specialized situation regarding size, would this be a product for you.

B00HZYDCUE,"on May 29, 2014",A1BXVZSQOJE6UE,Same Coke Taste In a Smaller Package,"I love the idea of having a smaller size can of Coke.  I've been drinking Coke since I was a kid and never had a problem drinking even the larger glass bottles (yes, that's dating me a little).  Now that I'm older I still crave the same Coke taste, but my my ""middle age spread"" doesn't.  People have suggested I try Coke Zero or Diet Coke, but I just can't stand the ""chemical taste"" of these diet drinks and the fake sugars frequently give me a rumbley in the tumbley. Because of this I often found myself trying to share a 12 oz can with my spouse or children, putting a half-empty can in the fridge ""for later"", or worse yet, buying 2 Liter bottles that would typically lose their fizz while still half full.<br /><br />That's why I really appreciated these 7.5 oz cans.  Not only are they just the right amount for me to drink in one sitting without feeling I cheated too much, the reduction in total calories from 139 to 87 helps me keep off excess pounds without feeling like I have to live like a joyless hermit.  In addition, these 7.5 oz cans are better for whipping up mixed drinks without, again, having a bunch of half-empty can sitting around the house.  And for those of you who think you are getting ""less soda for the same price"", eight 7.5 oz cans give you the same amount of Coke as a six-pack of 12 oz cans - 60 ounces.  Finally I liked the smaller cans for my younger kids.  The can is smaller in diameter and lighter so I worry a little less about making sure they are holding it tight enough or with both hands so as to now drop the can.<br /><br />Overall I really like the smaller size, fewer calories per can (without having to settle for ""fake Coke"" flavor), and the better portability of these small cans!",5

And quite frankly, it's often served in cups or other containers a great deal larger than I'll drink.<br /><br />These small cans are the perfect size as it's a more reasonable serving and less product is wasted than when using a regular size can.  So many tend to abandon their drink when drinking directly out of a can once it's no longer cold.<br /><br />The only drawbacks to using these small cans is the price and the fact that you can't put them back in the fridge if you don't drink the whole thing without it losing its fizz.

In 1963 they introduced the vile tasting TAB. In 1982 almost 20 years later they introduced Diet Coke which while tasting better  than TAB, it was still inferior to rival Diet Pepsi introduced in 1964 (test marketed as Patio Diet Cola in 1963). Coke Zero introduced in 2005 was marketed to men as the Madison Ave consensus was that  men felt &#34;diet&#34; drinks were for women. The formula  finally tasted like Coca-Cola.  As to the size of this Mini-can , I guess they were humoring former Mayor Bloomberg in his campaign against large sized drinks. The 12 oz size is more cost effective as are the two liter bottles.

For the simple reason that these eight little cans provide 7.5 fluid ounces of refreshment.<br /><br />Grab one of these eight packs, toss it into a cooler or in your fridge at home and drink them until you're a happy camper.  The small size is excellent for portion control, especially if you get regular Coke or another drink that's loaded with calories.  Ration these smaller cans out so that you can get your soda fix, but won't shoot yourself in the foot calorie-wise.  Yes, I know that Diet Coke is calorie-free, but it still is a good idea to keep your consumption of any sodas, diet, regular, or otherwise, to a minimum.<br /><br />Recommended for their ease of toting around and portion control.",4

It's barely three mouthfuls of the delicious elixir.  The whole pack, in total, is the equivalent of over 56 ounces.

I ordered these Coca-Cola Mini-Cans (8 Count), 7.5 Fl. oz. each. I believed that this order was the 8 Fl. oz. (8 count) at the time of my order.<br /><br />When we received these mini cans; they are really smaller, and it is very noticeable.  Based on my oversight at the time of my order, the realization hit me when I received this 8 count mini-can set products. I also realized that we were losing ounces equal to the 8 Fl. Oz can.<br />We all enjoyed them, yet noticed that the amount of sips that we are accustomed to was less, so my family members kept teasing me throughout the entire time we were using this product.  Since we love Coca-Cola in our household, we enjoyed them, although we have noticed a few sips less.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to others, and Amazon Customers. Coca-Cola has the same great taste, a great drink to have with snacks, meals, or on the go, if you like sodas. This is a perfect size for people who do not usually want an 8 Fl. oz can of soda, and would like a mini-size.  The Seller was accurate in their description of this product, delivery and packaging timely. I think it is fascinating how this soft drink was created in 1886 in Atlanta, Georgia by John S.

Its just about the right size for me - and when I make mixed drinks these are perfect!  So I guess that's an added bonus.<br /><br />I know some people have opinions about HFS and HFCS.  I for one really don't care as I really don't drink that much soda.  If you look at the lab tests for the HFS and HFCS you will have to note that an amount which exceeds 100,000 times the yearly average human intake was administered to get cancers or diseases to develop in the test subject.  So basically if you don't  consume soda in truly massive quantities you will never have to worry about the claims of cancer or strange disease association.<br /><br />I do like the 'throwback' soda though - the real sugar taste is more to my liking and its not near as sweet as most American produced soda is now.

Some would say that the 7.5 oz. cans are too small but with added ice they fill an 8 oz. glass and that is all one sometimes needs to quench thirst. The smaller cans are also good for travel and for packing in children's lunches.,4

As an adult male, 7.5oz of coke is not quite enough for a serving, which means I'll end up drinking 2 of them in a sitting (15oz). In that case, a 12oz can probably would have been ok, too. So what I end up with here is basically 4 servings of coke for basically the same price as 8 servings if I were to buy 12oz cans.<br />I suppose that these cans might work well for children, but even then, don't fool yourself into thinking that you're really saving money here by not being &#34;wasteful&#34;.",3

It probably suffices to say that I could down a pack of Coke Zero in a day without thinking twice. Perhaps that's why it's nice to have these smaller, 7.5 oz cans. While most of us are used to 12 oz cans, 7.5 oz is really a pretty good size to pair with a snack or a small lunch. This isn't a huge issue for zero calorie sodas like Coke Zero, but it definitely helps portion control for regular sodas.<br /><br />You will however pay for the smaller-sized cans.

On the other hand, she thinks that 12 oz. is about the right size most of the time. Therefore, she isn't likely to buy 7.5 oz. cans, especially if they cost more per ounce than 12 oz. cans.

Regardless of feeling silly for reviewing Coke, I got this product via the Vine program so its my duty to review it. Not a big shocker here but Coke tastes great. I like Pepsi too and dont really have a preference between the two. Im not even sure I could tell the two apart but anyways, Coke is tasty and comforting. It also gives you some temporary energy, it soothes a cough or a sore throat, it helps cramps, itll clean a car bumper, it makes an excellent drink mixer, and it settles an upset stomach. The 8 oz. can is nice for forcing you to drink less of it, thereby cutting a few calories. The smaller can is also more handy and portable. For example, it fits nicely into the pocket of a cycling jersey. Yes even warm Coke tastes pretty good. The smaller can might also reduce some of the guilt you get for drinking Coke because theres no denying thats its bad for you. But Im not going to focus on the nutrition of Coke (or lack thereof) because Im not here to review that aspect of the product. We all know soda isnt good for you and you should eliminate or at least moderate your consumption of it.  I mostly avoid drinking Coke and all other sodas but after a long bike ride nothing tastes better than Coke. Theres a reason youll see pro cyclists drinking this stuff during races.

And, I will always drink the entire thing by myself, which is not exactly good for me.  To encourage myself to drink more water and less soda, I thought I would try these baby cans.  My first glance at the can made me go into a bit of immediate withdrawal, but once I poured the can into my glass with ice, it wasn't nearly so bad.  I found that if I drank it from the glass and not with a straw, the drink lasted longer and being that the can is only 7.5 ozs, I didn't overdo it.

Plus it's kind of expensive too, if you can't find it on sale. Out of the major brands, I will take Coke Zero every time. In fact, I almost never drink regular Diet Coke ever since Zero came out. The taste is much better, attempting to more closely mirror Coke Classic (something that Diet Coke doesn't actually aim for, it has always been a different - and in my opinion - not very good flavor). The old, discontinued Pepsi One was actually the best ever, but it's long gone. Like many people, I am leery about the chemicals in this drink but I don't sweat it too much under moderate consumption.<br /><br />As for the mini-cans, eh - they're okay I guess. I prefer a standard 12 oz can ultimately. But I don't fault the product itself simply because it's been offered in a smaller container. If you want to try limiting your intake of soda, it's possible the smaller can will do the trick - especially if you take on the road or bring it to work, school, etc. But at home, if you're anything like me, you might just find yourself reaching for a second one - in which case you'd be better off opting for the full-size cans.",5

Using the current retail prices (Publix in SC) the two liter container at $1.99 each gives you the lowest price, $0.029 per oz..  The half-liter bottles, sold six for $3.99 gives you a price of $0.039 per oz.  The twelve pack of twelve oz. cans at $5.99 results in a price of $0.042 cents per oz.  And the Diet Coke Mini-Cans sold as eight for $3.99 gives a price per oz. of $0.067 (the highest price per oz.)<br /><br />I do not see the market for this small size can, due to its higher price per oz.  Maybe there is a convenience factor, if one has lots of small children, but then the two liter bottle seems to fill the bill, unless the children are getting the cans themselves and cannot be trusted to fill a glass from the two liter size.<br /><br />Only if you have some specialized situation regarding size, would this be a product for you.

Now that I'm older I still crave the same Coke taste, but my my ""middle age spread"" doesn't.  People have suggested I try Coke Zero or Diet Coke, but I just can't stand the ""chemical taste"" of these diet drinks and the fake sugars frequently give me a rumbley in the tumbley. Because of this I often found myself trying to share a 12 oz can with my spouse or children, putting a half-empty can in the fridge ""for later"", or worse yet, buying 2 Liter bottles that would typically lose their fizz while still half full.<br /><br />That's why I really appreciated these 7.5 oz cans.  Not only are they just the right amount for me to drink in one sitting without feeling I cheated too much, the reduction in total calories from 139 to 87 helps me keep off excess pounds without feeling like I have to live like a joyless hermit.  In addition, these 7.5 oz cans are better for whipping up mixed drinks without, again, having a bunch of half-empty can sitting around the house.  And for those of you who think you are getting ""less soda for the same price"", eight 7.5 oz cans give you the same amount of Coke as a six-pack of 12 oz cans - 60 ounces.  Finally I liked the smaller cans for my younger kids.  The can is smaller in diameter and lighter so I worry a little less about making sure they are holding it tight enough or with both hands so as to now drop the can.<br /><br />Overall I really like the smaller size, fewer calories per can (without having to settle for ""fake Coke"" flavor), and the better portability of these small cans!",5

The size would be convenient for travel, sticking one in a bag to carry with you, or maybe more importantly, the bar where you could probably make two bourbon and cokes.

One of the cans was detached from the plastic rings, but no problem.<br /><br />I haven't tried this 7.5 oz size, but I actually found it to be perfect.

It is cheaper to get a full size can, especially when they're on sale, so why choose this smaller can?<br /><br />I now know why! I've been trying to cut down on diet coke, but found myself wanting a taste of it, and once open, I of course drink the entire can, not wanting to waste it. So these little cans were perfect to help me cut down on my diet coke consumption.<br /><br />Another perk of these little cans is that the temperature of the soda is perfect. Often I'll open a full size can and by the time I finish it, it isn't as cold as I prefer. With these smaller servings, I can finish the can while it is cold.<br /><br />Other than all this, it really is the same diet coke I love.",5
B00HZYDH7M,"on May 27, 2014",A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW,Love the size.,"This product, in this size is perfect, especially if you want some help with portion control. This size is perfect for those who are doing various diet plans, watching their weight or worried about the amount of soda that they drink. Each can has less than 8oz (7.5), which means you don't fill too full (when you finish drinking it) and you don't have a fridge full of half open sodas (considering those large cans have about 12 fluid ounces). They are definitely perfect for those who just want a taste/sample, but not an entire can of drink. Especially when you consider that leaving the remainder in the fridge usually means drinking a flat soda later or discarding it. These small cans have just enough soda in them to hit the spot and leave you feeling satisfied. And did I mention that these cans are small enough to put in your lunch box or purse? My husband agrees and finds that they are perfect since he can slip them into his lunch box and his tiny office fridge.<br /><br />For some consumers, the only drawback.....whether you order these thru Amazon or go into the store, may be the cost. There are eight (7.5 fluid ounce cans) for $3. This may seem a tad expensive for some since you can get a 12 pack, of the larger can size, for under $5. But for those that the money is no issue, and they like the convenience of the smaller cans (or having just the right amount of soda), they may not flinch at the price. Overall, I give this product a 5....you have the same great taste and the perfect size!",5

I drink it in a twelve ounce glass with lots of ice and it's pretty satisfying, allowing me to feel like I'm drinking a full glass without getting quite so much sugar; but if I do want a second can, that's manageable as well. It's also a good size if you're looking to split a shot of liquor in a rocks glass. I wouldn't care to drink it straight from the can, I'd probably feel jilted.

You get all the great Coke taste without that odd aftertaste.<br /><br />Now, it gets that great taste through the use of aspartame as an artificial sweetener, so if you think aspartame is out to kill us all then Coke Zero is not for you.

Coke Zero introduced in 2005 was marketed to men as the Madison Ave consensus was that  men felt &#34;diet&#34; drinks were for women. The formula  finally tasted like Coca-Cola.  As to the size of this Mini-can , I guess they were humoring former Mayor Bloomberg in his campaign against large sized drinks. The 12 oz size is more cost effective as are the two liter bottles.

The small cans make me much less likely to over consume the soda and I rarely ever just drink 1/2 the 7.5oz can.  Its just about the right size for me - and when I make mixed drinks these are perfect!  So I guess that's an added bonus.<br /><br />I know some people have opinions about HFS and HFCS.  I for one really don't care as I really don't drink that much soda.  If you look at the lab tests for the HFS and HFCS you will have to note that an amount which exceeds 100,000 times the yearly average human intake was administered to get cancers or diseases to develop in the test subject.  So basically if you don't  consume soda in truly massive quantities you will never have to worry about the claims of cancer or strange disease association.<br /><br />I do like the 'throwback' soda though - the real sugar taste is more to my liking and its not near as sweet as most American produced soda is now.

Now that I'm older (and wiser?), the &#34;mega-size&#34; bottle of soda is, quite frankly, too BIG!  I'm old enough to remember when 7oz glass bottles were the norm (which then grew to 10, 16, half-litre, 24 oz, etc).  In other words a &#34;special treat&#34; and not one's sole source of hydration!<br /><br />These cute 7.5 ounce cans of Sprite are just the right size for a tasty treat of a carbonated beverage.

But, I digress.<br /><br />My only wish would be that Coca-Cola would offer their products using cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup.  Heck, I'd even be willing to pay MORE for that!  I also wonder about the efficacy of buying this product through the mail.  A couple of the cans broke free from their neck rings and were loose in the Amazon box.  I'd hate to imagine the mailman dropping the box and having one rupture!  At any rate, the PRODUCT itself is a FOUR STAR IDEA.  I'd give it five stars if it used regular sugar instead of HFCS.

While carbonated drinks aren't terribly good for your kidneys, especially if you drink 16 fluid ounces or more per day, the recommendation is to go with a clear drink (such as Sprite) as it is easier for your kidneys to break down, and this smaller size should appeal to those worried about the 16 oz limit and yet who are craving a taste of Sprite.<br /><br />Overall, I can't see where you can go wrong with this and I highly recommend it!",5

Not cutting it out completely, because did I mention that I love it?

B00HZYDJMU,"on June 2, 2014",AVWWFK3FZDEL2,Just the right size,"I drink mostly water and when I do drink a soft drink, I don't drink a lot unless I'm very thirsty, so these little 7.5 oz cans are just about perfect.  They're a little more than half the size of the regular cans and with ice will fill a 10 oz cup completely up.  Or you can put a little more ice and use a 12 oz cup.  Either way, it's less sugar, but still a nice cold drink for a hot day.  It would be especially good for kids and an excellent way to cut down on their &#34;sugary drink&#34; consumption without taking it all away.  The smaller can will take up less room if you're packing a small cooler with lunch and a drink, also, leaving you more room for ice to keep it cool.",5
B00HZYDJMU,"on June 1, 2014",A1FH14TQSVDH1X,Just enough and never too much.,"I've read some reviews for this size of drinks and I find them rather baffling.  They seem to be more of a political commentary than what these drinks are intended.<br /><br />I discovered this size of drink some years ago with Coke bottles that BJ's warehouse store sells during Christmas time.  They are perfect for me.  Since then obviously many more people feel the same since Coke and and now Pepsi have increased the number of their drinks for this size.  I notice that I rarely want a soda of a larger size and I love how easily these smaller cans fit in my lunch bag.  Yes, they do cost more per ounce and I wish that would change.  Thus far, I only buy them when they are on sale.  But overall, I always look for them or I don't buy any.",5

I try to save half of it, and with cans that really doesn't work well, since the pop goes flat pretty quickly.<br /><br />It's nice to see that beverage companies are realizing one size doesn't fit all; so whether someone wants to consume less calories or doesn't drink a full can, this is another option. This size is really pretty perfect for one serving, and this way nothing goes to waste. It's about just right for me when I drink it with a meal.<br /><br />As for Sprite in general, it's my favorite citrus pop, and it's really a refreshing flavor.",5

Most people have tried Sprite, as it is a top brand.  For those of you that haven't, it is a variation on Sierra Mist or 7-up.  As far as the size, 7.5 ounces is TINY in comparison to a normal sized 12oz.  Others are saying it is a perfect size when watching calories, but for me, I will drink two of them to feel like I drunk enough, which is 15 oz vs 12 oz.  If you feel that a normal can is plenty, then this will work for you.  If you easily drink a 12oz, then continue to get that size.  One star off due to how tiny this is and the increased cost because of it.",4

It is caffeine free, made with 100% natural flavors, and has a crisp, clean taste that really quenches your thirst&#34;. Having never tried Sprite, we were anxious to taste this lemon-lime soda, especially, since it does not contain aspartame. Sprite is light with a nice tangy taste, plus it comes in neat 7.5 fluid ounce cans at 90 calories. Highly recommend this refreshing soda in the small cans.",5

B00HZYDJMU,"on May 27, 2014",A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW,Same great taste and just the right size.,"This product, in this size is perfect, especially if you want some help with portion control. This size is perfect for those who are doing various diet plans, watching their weight or worried about the amount of soda that they drink. Each can has less than 8oz (7.5) and only 90 calories. You don't fill too full (when you finish drinking it) and you don't have a fridge full of half open sodas (considering those large cans have about 12 fluid ounces). They are definitely perfect for those who just want a taste/sample, but not an entire can of drink. And for those who want to use these in their kid's lunches, they are the perfect size. Not to mention, the teachers will love the fact that you were considerate enough not to give your kids too much sugar.<br /><br />And for those consumers who may question paying $3 for 8 small (7.5 ounce) cans of soda (on Amazon or in the store)....especially since you can get a 12 pack, of the larger can size, for under $5, they should consider the convenience. Having smaller cans with just the right amount of soda can be invaluable. What kid wouldn't want to open their lunch box and find this cute little can? Overall, I give this product a 5....you have the same great taste and the perfect size!",5

B00HZYDJMU,"on May 26, 2014",A2V55J9CCQCOG0,From a reliable soft drink company if you drink soft drinks.,"I can remember as a kid when Sprite's competition was Teem. They looked similar but Sprite was always a little crisper without that dull undertaste of other clear drinks, including ginger ale. Nowadays the competition is Sierra Mist I guess but, when available, I notice my daughter's first choice is always Sprite. Love the convenient smaller mini-can and the fact it still tastes the same as it did when I was a teenager. It's a refreshing soda that still stands out as the best of its kind - like its big sister Coke in the cola wars.",5
B00HZYDJMU,"on May 26, 2014",A1LVHR5OO45L5V,Crisp and clean - no caffeine!,"That was the old slogan from Coca-Cola Corporate - &#34;Crisp and clean - no caffeine.&#34; In this case, it is accuracy in advertising! Sprite is a product that has been around for decades mainly because it does offer a very tasty lemon-lime flavor and contains no caffeine.<br /><br />If you are someone who has problems with too much caffeine in your system or you just don't want it in every blessed thing you drink, Sprite is an excellent change of pace. As a matter of fact, before the two cola companies came out with decaffeinated versions of their flagship colas, Sprite was my post-morning-coffee drink of choice.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed the lemon-lime taste with enough citric acid in the drink to give you a non-caffeine kick like a good lemonade would. It's also a drink that I've always felt was less &#34;syrupy&#34; than the colas and gave you a better refreshing taste. I am a Sprite fan from way back and there's a reason for that. I recommend this product with five stars.",5

It's a good manageable size for the soda. I drink it in a twelve ounce glass with lots of ice and it's pretty satisfying, allowing me to feel like I'm drinking a full glass without getting quite so much sugar; but if I do want a second can, that's manageable as well. It's also a good size if you're looking to split a shot of liquor in a rocks glass. I wouldn't care to drink it straight from the can, I'd probably feel jilted. I haven't compared it by price with other case sizes, but at five cents an ounce I have to think you're getting a decent bargain.",5

And now comes the perfect solution: a mini-can that's only 7.5 fl oz! Tastes just as good and you won't have to force yourself to finish it or leave it for later.<br /><br />If you like Sprite but have always felt the regular size can was a bit big, this mini-can version is perfect for you.",5

The flashback of kids and adults with half full cans of pop left all over the place seemed like a waste.  My thought was smaller cans, less waste. Also, a greater possibility the drink would be finished.<br /><br />I know, I know despite all the healthy eating and cutting out of sugars and other products pop is a no no.

You can't tell the size from the picture.<br /><br />Third, the expiration date is only a few months off.<br /><br />Finally, the cans came loose easily from the plastic ring set (which I though were no longer used due to harming animals) and crushed some of the other products in my Pantry box.<br /><br />All-in-all, I was somewhat disappointed, even at this price I paid.",2

(8 count) at the time of my order.<br /><br />When we received these mini cans; they are really smaller, and it is very noticeable.  Based on my oversight at the time of my order, the realization hit me when I received this 8 count mini-can set products. I also realized that we were losing ounces equal to the 8 Fl. Oz can.<br />We all enjoyed them, yet noticed that the amount of sips that we are accustomed to was less, so my family members kept teasing me throughout the entire time we were using this product.  Since we love Coca-Cola in our household, we enjoyed them, although we have noticed a few sips less.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to others, and Amazon Customers. Coca-Cola has the same great taste, a great drink to have with snacks, meals, or on the go, if you like sodas. This is a perfect size for people who do not usually want an 8 Fl. oz can of soda, and would like a mini-size.

If you look at the lab tests for the HFS and HFCS you will have to note that an amount which exceeds 100,000 times the yearly average human intake was administered to get cancers or diseases to develop in the test subject.  So basically if you don't  consume soda in truly massive quantities you will never have to worry about the claims of cancer or strange disease association.<br /><br />I do like the 'throwback' soda though - the real sugar taste is more to my liking and its not near as sweet as most American produced soda is now.  The European Union I think has something going with respect to just how sweet American made soda's are.<br /><br />Mixes great with Rum, Seven, Jack Daniels",5

This one is too small. I can see the utility for those who would rather have a smaller portion, or for serving to kids when you don't want them to drink too much (I realize this is not the most healthy drink out there). It's also good if you want to take it somewhere and have limited storage space although if you take it and have no ice pack the prospect of drinking lukewarm or warm soda doesn't appeal to me at all.<br /><br />One thing about Diet Coke - it doesn't taste like the real thing. It has a sweeter taste to it and is missing a certain something that makes the taste less complex.  Coke Zero is very close to the real thing - it has the same character so if you want real Coca Cola but without the calories, I'd say that this is what you ought to buy.  And whether it be Coca Cola, Diet Coke or Coke Zero, they're all better than Pepsi.  And miles above Diet Pepsi.  Diet Pepsi is blecchhhhh!!!!",4

I did a side by side taste test and liked Coke Zero as much as regular Coke. However, I think Pepsi Max's taste is a little better - less ginger. Last point, buying it from Amazon may not be the best option. One can came out of the box crushed (but not leaking).

Coke Zero, if you've never had it, is the diet version of Coke, closer in taste to the real thing than Diet Coke. Though you can still taste the artificial sweetener that makes the drink &#34;sugar-free,&#34; in my opinion Coke Zero is much more palatable than Diet C.

These do have caffeine and since that can bother my sleep, I assume the smaller cans have less caffeine than the larger ones.  The only thing that does concern me a little is that these contain aspartame as the sweetener and there is some question about how safe that is.  With the exception of stevia, probably none of the artificial sweeteners are good for us, but if you are going to drink a diet or zero calorie soda anyway, this is one of the best tasting in my opinion.  If you never tried Coke Zero, try it, as I think you will like it.  There are not very many diet drinks that I like the taste of, but this is one that I do like.",5

This small size, a little more than half a regular 12-ounce can, is perfect to minimize waste.  Plus it has the benefit of fitting more easily into a crowded ice chest.

The half-liter bottles, sold six for $3.99 gives you a price of $0.039 per oz.  The twelve pack of twelve oz. cans at $5.99 results in a price of $0.042 cents per oz.

Because of this I often found myself trying to share a 12 oz can with my spouse or children, putting a half-empty can in the fridge ""for later"", or worse yet, buying 2 Liter bottles that would typically lose their fizz while still half full.<br /><br />That's why I really appreciated these 7.5 oz cans.  Not only are they just the right amount for me to drink in one sitting without feeling I cheated too much, the reduction in total calories from 139 to 87 helps me keep off excess pounds without feeling like I have to live like a joyless hermit.  In addition, these 7.5 oz cans are better for whipping up mixed drinks without, again, having a bunch of half-empty can sitting around the house.  And for those of you who think you are getting ""less soda for the same price"", eight 7.5 oz cans give you the same amount of Coke as a six-pack of 12 oz cans - 60 ounces.  Finally I liked the smaller cans for my younger kids.  The can is smaller in diameter and lighter so I worry a little less about making sure they are holding it tight enough or with both hands so as to now drop the can.<br /><br />Overall I really like the smaller size, fewer calories per can (without having to settle for ""fake Coke"" flavor), and the better portability of these small cans!",5
B00HZYDM3Q,"on May 29, 2014",AQNX0WN00JEVE,Great size for my favorite soft drink - 4.5 stars,"Coke has been my favorite soft drink for as long as I can remember.  It's got a sharper bite to it than any other cola and when served ice cold, is incredibly refreshing.  This is my caffeine source of choice.<br /><br />But we all know by now how harmful sugar is and that we're all consuming a heck of a lot too much.  And quite frankly, it's often served in cups or other containers a great deal larger than I'll drink.<br /><br />These small cans are the perfect size as it's a more reasonable serving and less product is wasted than when using a regular size can.  So many tend to abandon their drink when drinking directly out of a can once it's no longer cold.<br /><br />The only drawbacks to using these small cans is the price and the fact that you can't put them back in the fridge if you don't drink the whole thing without it losing its fizz.  My personal preference is buying Coke in plastic bottles (not the liter size ones), keeping a cap on the bottle until I'm ready to take a sip.  On the other hand, cans are much easier to stack if you're buying in bulk.",5

Initially, I thought the cans were far too small to quench my thirst. But, lo and behold, I found that a can, poured over ice, is perfectly adequate either with a meal or as an in-between beverage break.<br /><br />The eight cans in the multi-pack, once removed from the plastic binding, fit easily in the refrigerator and are handy whenever I want to grab one. Their size allows them to fit easily, even between casserole dishes or large containers. They fit practically anywhere. You will also discover that many more of the 7.5-ounce cans will fit in a cooler than the standard 12-ounce size. This is a benefit when you're on a picnic, at the beach, or away from refrigeration. On ice in a cooler, these cans do very well keeping the Coke nicely chilled.<br /><br />Of course, the flavor is strictly personal. I happen to like both Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi. I'm not a passionate advocate for either. Both are flavorful and hit the spot to quench thirst.  You might consider a multi-pack of these small cans if you've found that those 2-liter bottles of soda take up too much space in your refrigerator and often go flat before the bottle is finished.

This size is perfect for those who are doing various diet plans, watching their weight or worried about the amount of soda that they drink. Each can has less than 8oz (7.5), which means you don't fill too full (when you finish drinking it) and you don't have a fridge full of half open sodas (considering those large cans have about 12 fluid ounces). They are definitely perfect for those who just want a taste/sample, but not an entire can of drink. Especially when you consider that leaving the remainder in the fridge usually means drinking a flat soda later or discarding it. These small cans have just enough soda in them to hit the spot and leave you feeling satisfied. And did I mention that these cans are small enough to put in your lunch box or purse? My husband agrees and finds that they are perfect since he can slip them into his lunch box and his tiny office fridge.<br /><br />For some consumers, the only drawback.....whether you order these thru Amazon or go into the store, may be the cost. There are eight (7.5 fluid ounce cans) for $3. This may seem a tad expensive for some since you can get a 12 pack, of the larger can size, for under $5. But for those that the money is no issue, and they like the convenience of the smaller cans (or having just the right amount of soda), they may not flinch at the price.

B00HZYDW5E,"on February 20, 2016",A3B6SCSI5HE6AS,Amazing Classic Flavor!,"This is Coca Cola's greatest and longest lasting product idea. It is more well known around the world than just about any other brand. The flavor is hard to describe, but it is very good and borderline addictive. The classic red design with white letters is very distinctive - so much so that other companies attempt to copy that style as accurately as possible. The cardboard box is designed for easy use and easy storage and can be opened in such a way that the cans do not roll out of the fridge. For those of you who are concerned with the &#34;enormous amount of calories&#34; that one can of coke contains, be aware that many sodas have the same or more calories than coca cola, and they do not taste nearly as good. I prefer this to Pepsi, and will order this over its counterpart as long as I have a choice. It tastes good enough that I don't mind drinking it while it is lukewarm, but of course it is always better to refrigerate it before drinking for best results. Personally, I do not like to drink this with ice, but I know that many people do like to do that. With 12 cans in this case, and with a price this low, you would be making a huge mistake by not buying this! There is a fairly low amount of caffeine in this drink compared to other drinks like coffee or strong tea and I do not feel the effects of the amount of caffeine no matter what time of day I drink this. Make sure to recycle your empty cans when you are done. I highly recommend this product to everyone!",5

Now, I only get sugar sweetened COKE when I travel to Australia or SE Asia, because Asians smartly won't drink corn syrup in pop.  Sadly, I's far better than anything in the USA today.  Drinking DIET sodas, including diet coke, I ALWAYS get a slight buzz headache EVERY time I drink phenylalanine sodas.  EVERY - SINGLE - TIME - caffeine or not.  Not even a few shots of hard liquor will do that to me.  Switch to regular, and I often get a slight headache and always feel an energy let-down after drinking a corn syrup beverage--and I also get plenty of calories.  Honestly, straight sugar and it's high and letdown is a better experience than phenylalanine or corn syrup soda is.

B00HZYDW5E,"on July 7, 2015",A2P79AS51LMCJP,Stimulates the pleasure centers of the brain just like a low-grade line of cocaine,"I just quit soda, yesterday. Coke was my go-to for 35 years. I referred to it as 'fuel' or black gold'. It will be missed. Fighting off the sugar withdrawals. Soda is one of the most consumed beverages in the United States, second only to water. Here in the States, Americans guzzle 57 gallons of soda per person every year, as if it wasnt full of sugary calories. But whats happening inside the bodies of soda consumers with each sip?<br /><br />As soon as soda's swallowed, the pancreas is notified and rapidly begins to create insulin in response to the sugar. Insulin is a hormone the body uses to move sugar from food or drink into the bloodstream, where cells are then able to use sugar for energy. Within just 20 minutes, blood sugar levels spike and the liver responds to the insulin by turning sugar into fat for storage.<br /><br />Within 45 minutes of gulping down a single 20-ounce glass of soda, caffeine from the drink is fully absorbed, and as a result your pupils dilate and blood pressure rises. The body produces more dopamine, which stimulates the pleasure centers of the brain  just like a low-grade line of cocaine.<br /><br />When the hour chimes, the body begins to experience a blood sugar crash, which is around the same time a person reaches for their second soda, or for another sweet and sugar snack to suffice. Sodas connection to the obesity epidemic is so intertwined, Harvard researchers have calculated each additional soda consumed increases the risk of obesity 1.6 times.<br /><br />n addition to the threat of reaching obese levels, researchers also found after following 40,000 men for two decades, those who drank a sugary beverage each day had a 20 percent increased risk of having a heart attack. The high fructose corn syrup  a cheap replacement for cane sugar  has been associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome, which leads to diabetes and heart disease.<br /><br />Beverage companies know the haphazard sugar cycle all too well. In the United States, they spend approximately $3.2 billion in marketing each year in an effort to tempt consumers to pick up a liter of brown bubbly sugar with their pizza, or a case of cans for their childs next birthday party. Those little children have an 80 percent increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes if  they become regular soda drinkers. Their future will be one full of kidney problems, reproductive issues, osteoporosis, asthma, and bad teeth with dissolved tooth enamel.<br /><br />Drink up!",5

At first I thought we were getting counterfeit goods here in the states, but the coke flavor has stayed bad for a few years now.  It seems to be uniform over cans, small bottles, and large bottles.  It's kind of a shame that the old standbys are being taken down one by one and replaced with simulated treats that just don't taste that good.",2

Most times Coca-Cola is either very expensive, especially around holidays, sports game seasons, etc., when you are charged at a higher rate for the product, paying more for the displayed designs on the product, rather than the product itself.  A lovely tasting brand, although I am sure that many Pepsi lovers would debate this preference with me and other people. I liked the fact that this product has 12-cans in the product, is a reasonable price, and available through the Prime Pantry Program.  I have purchased this product a few times through the Prime Pantry Program, and I am pleased with the packaging, product, and the reasonable price.<br /><br />My only concern is that sometimes when purchasing through the Prime Pantry Program, it seems to fill the box up at a higher percentage rate than I think leaving me with the option to purchase less in my Prime Pantry carton.  When purchasing this product, I sometimes place all the drinks in one carton, and then I can order the rest of my groceries/purchases afterwards.  The Seller has described this product accurately.  I would recommend to others, as well as Amazon Customers.  I love the fact that Amazon has offered this product at a more reasonable price than I have seen in the stores around my neighborhood.

And not only do I dislike the taste of it, but the potential effects to the teeth and brain scare me. And diet Cola might be even more harmful, considering people think since it's healthIER they can drink it like water. However, for those people who cannot go without Coca Cola AND have Amazon Prime, this is a pretty good deal (at least for online). The most you'd pay is .68 per bottle (if you do your math right). Delivery is fast, three days at the most. The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the price is not very competitive compared to Costco and other brick-and-morter stores.",4

It has the same great Coca Cola flavor without so much sweetness and without so many calories - in fact it has zero calories, hence the name. The sleek black design really fits in well with the rest of the Coca Cola family. The cardboard box is designed for easy use and easy storage and can be opened in such a way that the cans do not roll out of the fridge. For those of you who are used to drinking regular coke or diet coke, I urge you to give this a try and I assure you that you will not be disappointed. I prefer this to diet coke and most other sodas. It tastes good enough that I don't mind drinking it while it is lukewarm, but of course it is always better to refrigerate it before drinking for best results. Personally, I do not like to drink this with ice, but I know that many people do like to do that. With 12 cans in this case, and with a price this low, you would be making a huge mistake by not buying this! I drink at least one can per day. There is a fairly low amount of caffeine in this drink compared to other drinks like coffee or strong tea and I do not feel the effects of the amount of caffeine no matter what time of day I drink this. I highly recommend this product to everyone!",5

Diet Coke only uses aspartame as a sweetener, while Coke Zero uses both aspartame and acesulfame potassium - the result is a much better taste in my opinion.<br /><br />Neither compares to Mexican Coke (the hipster glass-bottled Coke made with real cane sugar), but if you're watching your calories/carbs/sugar then Coke Zero is definitely a good bet.",5

B00HZYE51Y,"on March 13, 2015",A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,Give It A Try,"There will probably always be a war between Pepsi vs Coke. There are two camps out there and never the twain shall meet. Over a decade ago I reluctantly gave up my beloved Coke and switched over to very fizzy Diet Coke. It was by necessity. I downed at least 5 cans per day and I was consuming too much sugar. Plenty of teeth rotting sugar which given the quantities I was drinking was not good.<br />I adjusted to Diet Coke and was coping while still going through Coke withdrawal. To this day I still refer to Coke as the nectar of the Gods. I was fortuitously in Los Angeles when I first spotted Coke Zero prominently displayed at CVS. I wasn't expecting much but from the first sip I was hooked. Coke Zero isn't Coke. It is less effervescent, but only moderately so. However, the taste is so close to Coke that I can hardly taste the difference. I have never tasted a diet soda that tastes not only good but tastes like the real thing.<br />I was amazed to the extent that before I left LA I handed out my remaining cans to a diabetic friend and asked him to give it a taste test. By the time I landed I had a call from my friend singing the praises of Coke Zero. Fortunately, I live in a populous area and was able to locate Coke Zero in limited amounts. Gradually, Coke Zero gained in popularity and is now carried everywhere unlike the popular Mexican Coke made with pure cane sugar that has its own devoted following.<br />I encourage anyone who has yet to try this to give it a try. It is absolutely great and doesn't have a funky aftertaste. My only advice is do not hord the stuff. It has a shelf like of about two months and begins to lose its flavor and fizz after that.",5

If you have kids in the household, this size is a treat without being a soda overload. At a party, guests can grab one of these for a pick-me-up without having to hang onto a larger bottle for another half hour. My one star off is just because I think Coke Zero has a better overall flavor than straight Diet Coke.<br /><br />Price per ounce on these is higher than the popular 16.9 ounce bottle (which also seems to frequently be on sale in local stores), but it's still pretty reasonable---particularly if with the larger bottles you find yourself pouring out half-finished remains very frequently.

My mind won't accept it as a dark cola product, but when I just pretend it is a dark gingerale, it taste good & my mind accepts it as palatable. If you are having a difficult time drinking this, try pretending it is gingerale & see if your mind accepts -- the same way I couldn't eat carrots that weren't orange until I deleted the carrot label from my mind & called them something else. My mind expects specific flavors from items I've had before -- when the flavor is different my mind rejects it & falsely assumes I don't like it.

There are some studies indicating that Ace K can cause some tumors in some rodents. There are also some studies showing that sucralose can contribute to hypoglycemia.

I am trying not to drink diet soda's everyday, but from time to time it is a nice treat, and now knowing that they stopped putting aspartame in their diet soda, I am more of a fan.  The main reason I had switched to Diet Coke before was for the flavor.  I thought Diet Pepsi was a bit flat tasting, just didn't like the diet flavor of their product.

I only found one that really has touched me. I was twelve years old when I had my first soft drink. I would spend hours and hours researching the perfect drink for me. I heard about all the lies and witnesses about &#34;kidnapping&#34; live products. I believed it. Boy was I wrong. One day there I was drinking tea in the Wal-Mart parking lot, until the unexpected happened. There was a truck hauling products for the store.<br /><br />It went towards the back. I decided to leave moms mini van to investigate.The truck driver was already gone. I thought I should put these lies to rest and find out for myself what all the fuss was about.I turned the corner of the truck, and there it was. The door was open. It was filled with Mountain Dew, just plain Mountain Dew.<br /><br />It was stocked to the top of the inside of the truck and to the back. I heard and saw the boxes move. To be honest, it scared me a little. I was scared. But I have come a long way, and I couldn't give up. I had to do it. I grabbed one of the boxes and opened it... The next thing I saw wasn't pretty. The Mounatain Dew cases were ripped apart. Mountain dew everywhere, cans rolling around and moaning. One looked at me in the eyes and whispered &#34;please..kill me&#34;.<br /><br />I was so terrified that I dropped the box and ran. Luckily my mom was still in the car putting on make-up. Never will I shop from retail stores ever again. I will grow my own food from now. Take this as a helping hand...",5

That said, I've been drinking Mt. Dew for about fifteen years, and I love the flavor more than any other soft drink. I have narcolepsy, and, when combined with my medication, the sugar and caffeine content in Mt. Dew helps me maintain a pretty typical lifestyle. If I eliminate either of the two (medication or Mt. Dew), I can't function normally. So, while most people love to rant and rave about how horrible this stuff is the human body, I would argue that in some rare cases, it can actually be very helpful :). I understand there can be some negative long-term effects, but short-term effects of narcolepsy can also be pretty detrimental.",5

B00NU60GPK,"on February 27, 2015",A1K7UL93XMYHB3,FANTASTIC ROOT BEER! ((NOTE:: It has QUILLAIA)),"YUMMMMMMM I have no idea how I ended up in the root beer section but I'm glad I did. I read the reviews and decided to order since I had not had a root beer in years. This is a great tasting root beer! I remember A&W and when they'd come out and put that tray onto your window with your frosty mugs. That was so much fun. For taste this root beer is the best I remember, certainly FAR better than any store. I gave up sugar and only drink water but just had to get these for a treat. Ice cold and I swear my eyes roll back in yumminess. Now, to add a dollop of ice cream and I'm in heaven. Arrived well packed and on time. I will reorder!! The price is unbelievable too : ))<br />..<br />..........Went to re order 5/14/2015 and is no longer available so I googled 1 ingredient Quillaia in this product. Yikes O.O. - Scary! Think I'll look around for another drink without that in it.",5

These came in my prime boxes and I found that cans had crushed and leaked over my other items. Had a bit of a mess to clean. Had to discard several cans due to leakage. Pop tops still intact, so leaking had to be from cans being crushed. Product is quality, but shipping sucked. The 12 pack was also still intact but fell apart when I tried to lift the case out. Now, I had bought 4 twelve packs of soda, Two were packed with cans on their sides and two were packs with cans standing up and down. Those that were packed with cans on their sides were crushed in shipping.",3
B00NU60GPK,"on February 18, 2015",A2LEIANN1UZTHP,Zingy! Can handle being mixed half and half,"Mug is great cold or warm, zingier when warm (not refrigerated).  Either way, it mixes well with whey powder and Twinlab yeast for a meal replacement.  That's how I use it (add another 12-24 oz of water per can in a beer pitcher), so I can just drink the mixture when desired, no extra hassle.<br /><br />Alone, it's got 160 calories of pure sugar, so unless you're used to sugar you get high for 10-15 minutes after drinking.  Great taste.  Not as creamy as A&W or Hines (do they make Hines anymore?), but true root-beer 'zing'.  Gonna keep ordering it through Prime Pantry. :)",4

So of course during my prime pantry shopping with such a great deal I had to have a pack ordered for when my things come. It was the best choice I made.<br /><br />The flavor is the genuine of all, reminds me of the summer days when we all had the glass bottles from a long time ago. No Caffeine which is even more amazing because it doesn't actually take away from the flavor of the drink at all. No bitter aftertaste or anything left, just an overall enjoyable drink. The overall size of a can, and case is just the right amount for anyone or any family. A great deal, at a great price will be returning for more if not by next month probably by the end of next week.",5

My wife ended up buying it as a surprise.<br /><br />I don't remember much about Surge as a kid, but did remember it didn't last too long, so of course I forgot what it tasted like.  What I will say is that  for nostalgic reasons this is a fun drink to buy and start the nostalgia fest around friends, but otherwise it tastes exactly like everything else in the grocery store.<br /><br />Taste: so to me after drinking 3 cans: My first can I thought it tasted pretty weak, almost like a watered down 7up, but I've drank a couple more and the taste is actually pretty good.  I liken this MOST to a Mello Yello/7up hybrid.  It has a similar taste to Vault (RIP) as well.

B00OK0I4AO,"on March 18, 2015",A2YPCON7KYGEH3,"Stands the Test of Time, and Then Some!","Great stuff.  Drank this stuff a lot as a kid, and unlike most of the stuff I liked as a kid, Surge still stands the test of time as a truly outstanding beverage.  However, now I can do stuff with it that I couldn't as a child.  Like mix it with alcohol.  It mixes very well with all the basic liquors and pretty much anything fruity or relatively unflavored.  Here's a list of a few drinks I've mixed up with Surge, but it's certainly not all inclusive:<br /><br />Gauss Flare:<br />Fill glass with ice<br />1 part triple sec<br />1 part gin<br />Surge to taste, leaving a little splash room<br />Splash in Blue Curacao (substitute UV Blue Vodka if you don't like Curacao)<br /><br />Sting Chameleon (not sure of the exact measurements, was one heck of a party, so I'll just list the ingredients)<br />UV Blue Vodka<br />Lemon Bacardi<br />Coconut Rum<br />Surge<br /><br />Surge also tastes really well in a 2:1 ratio of Surge to liquor with all the essential liquors.<br /><br />However, Surge isn't only good as a mixer, but also as a stand alone beverage.  It's got a much clearer, crisper, and satisfying flavor than Mountain Dew, which I can't stand any more.  Surge has a nice hint of lime in it's delicious citrus flavor.  It's best served chilled, but unlike most soda beverages, it tastes quite adequately at room temperature, and on occasion I grab one on the way to work.<br /><br />It also boosts self esteem and confidence.  When you are drinking a can of Surge soda, you feel like you are the coolest raddest dude around.  You feel like you can take on anything armed with just your sheer amount of radness.  You will feel like you are a bad enough dude to save the president.  Drink a Surge before a job interview or a rough day to boost confidence and act more naturally and effectively.<br /><br />All in all, Surge is great stuff.  I am on my 3rd shipment of Surge right now, and when it's depleted I am definitely ordering more.  I order 3 cases at a time to fill my Pantry box, but I may switch to 6 cases at a time and fill 2 pantry boxes due to the stock waves that Amazon gets sometimes running out and then I am forced to wait a few weeks without my precious Surge before I can order more.",5

Honestly, I can't believe I liked the stuff then.  It's insanely sweet, and it's green.  It's better than Mountain Dew because you can actually taste a hint of some kind of actual citrus juice amidst the brutal sweetness. I've had the pallet in my fridge for months now, as a 16 oz can of the stuff is a pretty serious undertaking.  If you are really pining for the zany, optimistic flavor of the mid-90s, you should grab this product and sip your way back in time.

Is there a flavor packaged in a can that can fully sum up an entire decade? The answer, of course, is no. But Surge is pretty close! I ordered 2-12 packs for a 36 hour Halo binge, where a friend and I would play Halo:Reach all the way through Halo 4, without stopping or sleeping. What could keep us awake for that long? What could help us fight the Covenant while fighting sleep? The only superweapon we could think of was the item that our parents got banned in our childhood.<br /><br />This stuff is so good that it gave me a kidney stone after drinking it for only a week.<br /><br />Not kidding. Not lying. One week after receiving these and having our Halo binge, I woke up to a horrible pain in my back. I could not think, could not sit still. It was awful. I thought I was dying. I asked my Facebook friends what was wrong and what to expect, and my aunt told me she had a kidney stone and that the pain was worse than the birth of either of her children. After 24 hours of agony, I passed it. And it was all thanks to Surge. This drink is completely, totally worth it. This is the everclear of sodas. If you have an alcohol that completely destroys you and gets you black-out-peeing-on-a-sheriffs-car drunk, this is that alcohol... but with a soda.<br /><br />For the love of all this is right in this world, buy this soda. Drink it til you're peeing green rocks. Give yourself diabetes. It never tasted this good.",5

It is a sweet, tasty alternative to coffee. It is the cool uncle of the carbonate beverage family, who was erroneously thrown in jail until recently when he was proven innocent and released from holding. It is a citrus-flavored drop of Heaven, a dose of paradise, and a &#34;surge&#34; of energy (pun intended).<br /><br />Now I'll tell you what it does. Surge keeps you awake better than any energy drink, satisfies your thirst, and puts Mountain Dew to shame.<br /><br />I hope that this review was helpful.

Is there a flavor packaged in a can that can fully sum up an entire decade? The answer, of course, is no. But Surge is pretty close! I ordered 2-12 packs for a 36 hour Halo binge, where a friend and I would play Halo:Reach all the way through Halo 4, without stopping or sleeping. What could keep us awake for that long? What could help us fight the Covenant while fighting sleep? The only superweapon we could think of was the item that our parents got banned in our childhood.<br /><br />This stuff is so good that it gave me a kidney stone after drinking it for only a week.<br /><br />Not kidding. Not lying. One week after receiving these and having our Halo binge, I woke up to a horrible pain in my back. I could not think, could not sit still. It was awful. I thought I was dying. I asked my Facebook friends what was wrong and what to expect, and my aunt told me she had a kidney stone and that the pain was worse than the birth of either of her children. After 24 hours of agony, I passed it. And it was all thanks to Surge. This drink is completely, totally worth it. This is the everclear of sodas. If you have an alcohol that completely destroys you and gets you black-out-peeing-on-a-sheriffs-car drunk, this is that alcohol... but with a soda.<br /><br />For the love of all this is right in this world, buy this soda.

I thought it was an energy drink, from the name and the way the cans are, it's very reminiscent to Monster/Full Throttle/Rockstar. (But that's my bad, and the one star I took from the review isn't because of that.) Everyone in my household says it tastes a lot like sprite. I can see that, but I feel as if it has something added, just a bit more of a citrus flavor than sprite. And the flavor isn't overwhelming, it's actually kind of hard to get the flavor, you have to focus on it as you drink since it's really not that much of a flavor. It's also not very carbonated like most soft drinks. It is still pretty good though. I got it when it was back down to $15ish. If you drank this when it was out before then I say go for it, feel the nostalgia! But if you just want to try it, I'd say go for something else. Especially since the price gets very steep very quick and all the amazon reviews make it seem like it's something it's not (The nectar of the Gods). So you'd probably be a bit disappointed.",4

B00OK0I4AO,"on December 22, 2014",A3HT0JHJ6JS6AW,Fuel your 90s Nostalgia Goggles!,"To begin, this review contains many 90s references, and if that's an issue, I'm afraid you should stop reading. While I am only a 20-something and didn't get to experience the full glory of the decade that spawned the Internet and Furby's, I, like many others, purchased some Surge cola because of the nostalgia factor. As a child of the 1990's in pre-9/11 America, I have some fond memories of things that were awesome at the time such as: GAP clothing, trying to fit CD players into jean jacket pockets, 007 Goldeneye for the Nintendo 64, shopping malls not being the detritus of retail, 3D Doritos, Solo Jazz paper cups, Sobe drinks, overalls, attempted reboots at the Godzilla franchise, Pokemon Gold/Silver, and Skechers shoes. One thing notably absent from that list was Surge cola, something I never got the chance to try as a kid. My parents never really let me drink soda as a child and I didn't start drinking it until adulthood, so trying out Surge was a new experience altogether.<br /><br />I talked to some of my older friends and they have many great memories of Surge cola, but I can't relate as I never tried it. I guess Surge was in vogue for a few years in the latter part of the 1990s before being phased out in the early 2000s, and it's pretty cool to see it come back from public demand. French Toast Crunch was resurrected this year too, and will be on most store shelves in early 2015. The public spoke up and demanded Surge return, and some very smart people listened. When the news got around through my circle of friends, several of the older ones were raving about the old Surge and recommended I get a case to try. I was going to purchase a case from the initial run when they first came back to life, but hesitated and missed my chance, as they were out of stock. Amazon got some more in and I pulled the trigger, getting one of the last cheap cases. Today, the case came in.<br /><br />For starters I only had one soda, so I had a lot to consider when I first drank it. The can itself is a tall, green 16oz can with some really retro 1990s comic style lettering and design. The can looks like something out of the Simpsons; a comical throwback to the days of dial-up modems and Geo Metros. It looks pretty cool, i'm going to save a can to put on my shelf (I collect drink containers from various brands i've drank over the years.)<br /><br />As far as taste goes, I didn't really expect to be blown away but I didn't expect it to suck either, so that's why I gave it a 4/5 rating. I'm sure a lot of the more serious reviewers will compare this drink to Mountain Dew/Mello Yello. The soda tastes like a hybrid between those two, but with the smoothness of the latter and some of the &#34;bite&#34; of the former, mixed with some citrusy flavors. It has a bold flavor and it isn't too sour or sweet. I wish it would have had more of a sour character to it, but it is what it is. It's not a bad taste whatsoever! It goes down pretty smooth, not as bubbly as Mountain Dew or as smoothly as Mello Yello. All in all, not a bad soda in comparison to its modern-day contemporaries.<br /><br />I've read Surge is exclusive to Amazon for now, so get it while it lasts! I was lucky and managed to get my case with Prime 2-Day shipping for about $12, not a bad deal, about a dollar per can or so. I'm seeing cases for sale on Amazon now reaching upwards of $40-50 and while I'm thankful I got the good deal I did, when I did, I wouldn't spend more than $15 for a case, I didn't think it was that amazing.<br /><br />At the end of the day it's a fun, enjoyable soda to drink and reminisce about the days of the Clinton administration and N-Sync, but the honeymoon phase wears out after a while. If you can get a case cheap, do it, otherwise, I wouldn't say it's worth the money. This is the soda Millenials may remember enjoying, but can now try once again. I hope some of you won't take my opinions to heart, as nostalgia goggles can be blinding!",4

My hand shook as I placed my worn Korn cassette in the tape deck of my 1989 Plymouth Grand Voyager for the first time in 18 years.  As Johnathan Davis' asked inquisitively if I was ready,  I replied in the only way I could.... Yes Mr Davis.  Yes I am ready.<br /><br />The left speaker's been blown for as long as I've owned the van, but the tape had been played so many times that you probably couldn't tell anyway.  As I cracked the can for the first time and took a sip, Munky's throaty D-tuned guitar pounded in my head.  I immediately was angry at my parents for not letting my go to the party on Friday even though, like, EVERYONE is going to be there.  They are so completely out of touch, they have no idea who I am anymore.  I am so angry.<br /><br />I remembered that Kelly was going to be at the party and I haven't been able to talk to her yet.  Phil gave her my beeper number on tuesday in driver's ed, but she hasn't used it yet.  I need to find a way to sneak out and get to this party without my parents knowing.  I wonder if I put the van in neutral, could I push it down the street far enough so that when I start it, they wouldn't be able to hear my muffler-less rustbucket start... I could totally do this.<br /><br />By the time I finished the can, Side A of the tape was complete.  I remembered that there was no party on Friday, but I did have to go to work at the office and would probably be so tired when I got home that after my wife and I finished dinner, we'd just hang out on the couch and watch netflix.  I realized that I didn't have a beeper, my parents were right to not let me go to that party, and that I didn't actually own a van anymore...<br /><br />so who's van is this?",5

So as that I instantly disregarded all responsibilities and priories that had been poisoning my soul and placed my order.  The following weeks time began to feel like the into to an ac/dc song.  My younger more pregnant girlfriend didnt understand my anxiety and why I was scrambling to collect all Crash Bandicoot & Tony Hawk Pro Skater games that have long been collecting dust along with my Limp Bizkit and KoRn albums.  My 18 year old brother thought I was crazy when I tried to explain the times of Bill Goldberg slamming a Surge while preforming the &#34;Jack Hammer&#34; and staying up for days and eating pizza rolls and chugging the nectar of the gods.  So when the Surge finally arrived I chilled one and then once the time had came I popped the top and the aroma said it all... the SURGE was real... IT WAS NOT A DREAM... My 36 week pregnant girlfriend wanted to know what the hype was all about, so she took a few sips... needless to say within 1 hour my son was throwing a mosh pit in her stomach and spin kicked her lady parts right into submission... SO MY SON WAS FULLED BY SURGE AND CAME OUT OF HER EATING SLIM JIMS AND WEARING BRIGHT ORANGE PARACHUTE PANTS RECITING PAPA ROACH LYRICS.

I was so disappointed when Coke stopped selling it.  This stuff kills mountain dew.  So I had stumbled across the Surge movement a few months ago and how they had brought it back to Amazon.  I was debating when I wanted to order some.  I finally did and I got it in today.  I have to admit I was like a little kid waiting for the UPS truck to pull up.  Once it did, I was glad to know that the Surge was already cold from I guess being on the truck for so long.  Which was great for me because I didn't want to wait once second after bringing this in and unpacking it to crack one open, pour it, watch the green color, and then taste this manna sent from the God's above.<br /><br />Needless to say, I WILL be ordering more of this regularly from Amazon.  I really hope coke brings this back to the store.  I think they should look at a diet version or a version with splenda as well.  That way they can appeal to people who don't want ""so much sugar""  I can handle it personally.  But, just saying this may help their sales.  All I can say is WOW.  As soon as it hit my taste buds, I remembered drinking it all the time and it felt like I was in a time portal.  I honestly forget just how good this stuff tasted.  WOW, JUST WOW!",5

Today I hear the UPS truck pull in I'm excited my Surge is here,  I rush it inside open the box and see those classic Surge cans. I get a can out pop it open take a drink and.......am kind of dissapointed.  It is just Mello-Yello.  I know Mello-Yello hasn't been available in most of the country for awhile but in the midwest it was still pretty common until recently. So I may not have a recent memory of what Surge tastes like, but I do for a fact know what Mello-Yello tastes like and this is it.  I honestly do think they just put Mello-Yello in Surge cans to get money from nostalgic people like myself.  I thought this was the exact same recipe they used in the 90s. It isn't a bad soda or anything just defiantly not worth any more than a 12 pack from the store. Atleast the cans are cool looking. I won't be ordering anymore unfortunately.",3

I was born in 96, so I never really got the chance to drink Surge, and it went extinct before I really started drinking soda. Getting my 12 pack, I was happy to see all of the cans were perfectly intact. Not a single dent! I immediately cracked open a soda and tried a sip. It tastes much like other citrus sodas such as 7up, Sprite, and Mello Yellow, however it does have its own special *zing* to it. Its definitely a good soda. The aftertaste is a little better than the other mentioned sodas, but not by a huge amount. This product was obviously meant for the older 90's kids, but as one myself, it was kinda cool trying something new. That being said, it is a nice curiosity piece, but I probably wouldn't purchase another case simply because to me its so similar to the other citrus sodas. Good, but only the people who had the original stuff would really know the difference.",3

I was born in 96, so I never really got the chance to drink Surge, and it went extinct before I really started drinking soda. Getting my 12 pack, I was happy to see all of the cans were perfectly intact. Not a single dent! I immediately cracked open a soda and tried a sip. It tastes much like other citrus sodas such as 7up, Sprite, and Mello Yellow, however it does have its own special *zing* to it. Its definitely a good soda. The aftertaste is a little better than the other mentioned sodas, but not by a huge amount. This product was obviously meant for the older 90's kids, but as one myself, it was kinda cool trying something new. That being said, it is a nice curiosity piece, but I probably wouldn't purchase another case simply because to me its so similar to the other citrus sodas.

I woke up on Monday to the notification e-mail from Amazon that Surge had been re-stocked and I squealed as if Luke Perry from 90210 in 1992 had just sauntered into my bedroom, perched on the edge of my bed and begun strumming &#34;Here Comes the Sun,&#34; by the Beatles on a guitar that he named after me.....sorry, drifted off there for a second. Anyway, yes, the first day my case of Surge arrived I drank four cans. Four. On a side note, I am a person that does not generally drink a lot of soda, I find it overall to be too carbonated and don't like how much it burns. Surge, however, does not burn, it is perfectly carbonated and delicious. Thank you, Coke! On a new side note, I have an idea for a commercial: Ok, so we travel to the top Mount Olympus, and the circle of god are sitting around, bored in their palace of white pillars. Suddenly, Mercury runs in and holds up a can of Surge and shouts &#34;Last one!!&#34; and the gods all give each other knowing smiles and suddenly, woah, everybody has laser guns (ooh, ooh, and Hera totally catches Zeus giving the eye to some scantily-clad god-chaser and lasers the bimbo, and then turns around to glare at him while he gives the &#34;whatta you gonna do&#34; shrug) anyway, after a few scenes of neon-blast colored chasing, Mercury (he has the winged shoes, so I think he would win, but you could change that part) plops down in Zeus' chair and pops the cap on his Surge and takes a looong swig before smiling at the camera - Feel the Rush.",5

It arrived in 2 days, thanks to Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Now that I'm older, I have discovered that my memory isn't what it used to be. When the Surge arrived at my door, I had completely forgotten that I had even ordered it. Now in my possession again, I looked at the familiar label, smiled, remembering the good times. Where I, overexcited by the truly massive amounts of sugar and caffeine bounced off walls, ignored homework and played video games until it was time for more Surge.<br /><br />Which is all I can remember from my times drinking Surge. Were they good times? I have no idea. Were they bad times? No clue. Perhaps my memory problems started earlier in my life than I thought. Or, perhaps, my memory problems started with Surge. How would I know?<br /><br />Recalling my complete and utter lack of recollection, I did not even open a single can. I stuck them all in the basement, still bundled in the cardboard and plastic, a reminder of times long gone.<br /><br />What does it taste like, you ask? Did you forget that part already? Maybe you should cut back on the Surge. Me? I haven't a clue: they're still unopened in my basement.<br /><br />What do I THINK it tastes like, you ask? Good question! I imagine it's a smorgasbord of flavors: citrus, high-fructose corn syrup and mixed with hints of orange, nostalgia, and whole lotta regret.",3

After drinking my first few cans I started having these blackouts whenever I got angry.

When I went to the doctor to get tested he told me that my blood cells were inundated with tons of Gamma radiation and that I should stop drinking the product immediately or I would continue having these black outs.  I became so enraged by this that the next thing I knew I was standing in the rubble of what was once his office. Luckily for me the security footage was still there.  I found that when I drank this product I grew into a large green monster and went on a rampage.  I am now wanted by the authorities and am being hunted down by the US military.

First of all, my package was delivered on a Sunday. That never happens. Next I picked up the box and in disbelief I could barely move it. It was weighed down by the contents within. My first thought was &#34;hmm, did I order some dumb bells? Or perhaps some ultra heavy paper weights?&#34; Then I figured there was only one way to find out. I then proceeded to open the box and to my surprise a gleam of sunshine shredded the box and a green gust of wind pushed me back. I could barely open my eyes. I thought someone sent me a nuclear bomb. As the gust and blinding light slowly faded I finally saw before my eyes, the holiest of grails. The thing I have been longing for for multiple years. Surge. I then began to shed a tear. As my tear hit the ground I noticed that it was green. &#34;How?&#34; I asked. From that moment I realised. I became one with Surge. My life has been waiting for this moment and it is finally complete. If I were to be stampeded by multiple Bulls and/or elephants I would not cry from the pain and knowing I would die.

When I finally procured my shipment after months of waiting on re-stocks, I enjoyed it just as much as way-back-when!  Surge is a great product because it capitalizes on not just taste (which IMHO is light-years better than Mello Yello and even rivals Mountain Dew) but also nostalgia.  Just seeing that can design brings back some great childhood memories!<br /><br />I know that there was a movement of people who worked very hard to get this product back in production, but it also took Amazon to be the only retailer I know that is selling it.",5

B00OK0I4AO,"on November 15, 2014",A3IXMQOUXOEK43,Playing the long game,"When Surge was released in the 90's one of the many complaints by soda industry insiders was that it was marketed primarily toward children.  Not that anything was seen as wrong with that from a moral standpoint (although Coca-Cola claims to no longer market directly toward children).  The issue instead was that the children don't hold the wallet and without marketing toward parents Surge might not ever make it to the pantry.  Surge, with it's substantial amount of sugar also seemed to substitute more for a candy than for a soda (not that many were counting carbs at the time, it even advertised that it was loaded with Carbos).  So over the years of marketing to children and appealing only to those with a steadfast sweet tooth the market segment dwindled and without further injection of funds for marketing the product failed.<br /><br />Lesson learned...<br /><br />Except that a instant hit may have never been part of the plan at all.  Just as rumors abound about the switch from Coke to New Coke to Coca-Cola Classic, so too must I say this all seems a little too well thought out.  Millennials, who were children at the time of this marketing blitz are now full-fledged adults.  Now, much has been made of the Millennial generation and their adversity to soda, to high-carb drinks, and this has played itself out by year over year losses for total soda consumption in the USA.  Now though the Messiah has returned.  Rose from the dead, Surge will now rise to levels of popularity that can only be described as supernatural.  Coca-cola made a huge gamble in the 90's marketing this soda to children but now it is about to pay off to levels unseen.  The cult of the McRib?  Nothing compared to the marketing genius we are seeing at play here.<br /><br />I am one of those children to whom this sugary wonder was marketed once upon a time.  Those advertisements had a great impact on me, and the taste... I am now hooked for life with no hope of kicking my new $1.25/day habit.",5

Why they would allow people to use their site and sell cans for the same price as a case is asinine.

B00OK0I4AO,"on October 24, 2014",A3B20Y21LNS1MZ,Nostalgia! An honest review from an old Surge fan,"Surge soda has a &#34;colt-like&#34; following, and for good reason. I recently got my hands on 4 cases of Surge, for $14 a case. Yes, that's insane for soda considering you can find an average 12-pack of Coke on sale for about $4 per case at your local supermarket. But it's been over 10 years since I last had a Surge soda. It was one of my favorites. I can still remember back in 98 finishing a 12-pack of Surge at my Grandparent's house and getting a womping headache from drinking too much those 3 days. But, the fact that I remembered it was Surge I was drinking, shows how much I loved the soda. And no, I'm not some fat guy who pigs out and drinks soda all day everyday. Having a soda a couple times a week is perfectly fine.<br /><br />Anyway, on to the soda itself. Today I had a little taste test between Surge, Mellow-Yellow, and Sun Drop. Surge has the best color, it's like a toxic-green. Taste is great as well. As for Mellow-Yellow, the best way to describe its taste is &#34;okay&#34; &#34;plane&#34; or &#34;safe&#34;. It's a soda you would expect. Sun Drop has what I would consider to have the most carbonation. Again, taste is almost the same as Mellow-Yellow, but has more carbonation (Almost a club soda taste). I should have added Mountain Do, but everyone knows what that tastes like. It's in a league of its own over on the Pepsi side. Coke has boring Mellow-Yellow to compete......<br /><br />I really hope Coke can work something out to bring Surge to local markets (brick and mortar). After all, Pepsi brought back Throw-Back for a limited time, and it ended up staying. I would love to walk into my local 7-11 and pick up a bottle of Surge! You never know how much you miss something til its gone. (Just like 90's and early 00's rock music). haha",5

B00OK0I4AO,"on October 23, 2014",A3BBNVO0MNE98V,reSURGEnce,"12 years I have been cryogenically frozen. 12 long years. Just waiting for the day Surge came back on the market. So come to my surprise that I am slowly awaken to a world to which I think is still devoid of Surge. Maybe something must have gone wrong at the Cyro facility that myself and many others are kept at. Looking around, I see other pods also empty of people. In come scientists. Not one or two, but almost half a dozen. They quickly grab me before I fall and collapse to the floor due to muscle atrophy. Next thing I know, I am awaken on a table where all my vitals are being checked and my neural levels are analyzed. The next time I come around, I am in a plain white robe, on a standard cot in a non-descript room. In comes a scientist. He sits down and asks me how I feel. I say I am ok, but confused why I am awake. I ask if Surge has been brought back. He re-assures me that everything is fine and that I will need to follow him, if I am feeling strong enough. I try and stand. Legs are a bit wobbly, but I feel that I am able to be lead to where he wants to go. He offers to let me put my hand on his shoulder and lean as we walk to where he wants to go. Friendly fellow. We make small talk as we are lead to a plain steel door. He scans his badge and inputs a code.<br /><br />As the door opens, I see a smallish room with a window that is looking out over a beautiful lake. In the middle of the room, there is a steel table covered in a white table cloth with a single chair. There is something in the middle of the table, but I cant quite make it out. The kind scientist asks me to sit down and get comfortable. I make myself comfortable. Well, the best one can do in a semi-weakened state. He asks again how I am feeling. A bit perplexed, but I respond that I am still well. I notice his had moves to a cloth-covered item on the table. Curiously, I am wondering what strange thing is under it. Within half a second he removes the cloth. My heart freezes. To my eyes, there lies a pristine can of Surge. It seems larger than what I remember. My eye sight goes fuzzy, but I shake my head and re-focus on the can. Then I look at the scientist and back to the can. I realized I stopped breathing at this moment. A deep breath I inhale. On the exhale, I look at the scientist and before I can even mutter a word, he smiles as says 'Your eyes do not deceive you. That is an unopened can of Surge. And it is yours.'<br /><br />Tears spring to my face and a smile as wide as the can turned sideways appears on my face. The scientist reaches out and grabs the can. He hands it to me and my fingers tremble and fumble as I try to open the can. CRRSKK. The can is open. Aluminum on lips, I tip the can back and feel that sweet delicious flavor swirling around in my mouth and then down my throat. Next thing I know, the can is empty and a childhood happiness wells up inside of me. But a worry comes over me. I ask the scientist, 'Is this a dream? Or was there a secret stash found somewhere?' To my surprise, the scientist laughs and offers me a hand. We stand back up and he says to follow him. We go back to my room, all the while the scientist is making small talk about this and that, but keeps avoiding my questions about Surge. Upon returning to my room, he offers me to open the door. As the door slowly opens, I walk in a notice a box on my bed. I walk over to inspect it and notice it is a 12-pack of Surge! I cry out in surprise and happiness. The scientist smiles and says, 'It's all yours. Coca-Cola has brought it back and it is available via an online shop called Amazon. That 12-pack is yours and once you are strong enough to leave, you will have another 12-pack waiting at the exit.<br /><br />I thank the scientist for all that he has done. He makes his exit. I crack open another can. And before I know it, its gone. Then for the first time, I notice a fridge. In goes the surge, but another one is in my hand. I slowly drink on that can for a bit longer than the other two I had. By the end of the night, I have drank another 3 cans, each one a bit slower than the last. The smile on my face is one of pure happiness.",5

In slightly larger than average cans (fl oz), all of that amazing Surge flavor that you used to crave is packed inside. Now, I only drink one every so often, or on nights that we are having gaming parties or other activities that require me to stay up a bit; but when I do -- it is awesome! Love the flavor. It is clean and crisp -- just like it used to be.<br /><br />Here is a word of warning though, and I can't guarantee this would happen to you because it just must be what happens to my body when I drink it. This is a little embarrassing, but it is relevant and funny as well. I drank this about 30 minutes before having intercourse with my wife. I lasted FOREVER. Uncomfortably so...Meaning, I tried and tried to finish, but it literally took me nearly an hour. Of course, she loved it; but I was getting to the point of physical exhaustion. It was almost like torture.<br /><br />Like I said, that may not happen to everyone, but it did to me. As such, I avoid intercourse when I drink this; but for some reason, it also makes me unusually horny. I may be the only person on Earth this happens to; but regardless, I thought I'd put it out there.",5

Nice dark green color, very crisp, and citrusy with a faint hint of orange juice. Extremely refreshing. Brings back memories of the days of Sony Playstation and Nintendo 64 playing games like Resident Evil and Goldeneye in the the early morning hours with my friends. Thank you to the SURGE Movement for giving me a medium to fight to help to bring this back. Matt, Sean, and Evan put in more time, effort, and money out of their own pockets to bring this back than anyone, thank you so much for your hard work guys. SURGE was just a memory these past 12 years and now it's back and sitting in my refridgerator and I can hardly believe it.<br /><br />TO THE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE $250.00 PRICE. Grow a brain. That's not the Amazon price. Amazon is currently sold out. That's some seller selling it through their e-store on Amazon. Amazon always lists other sellers selling the same product. That e-store is trying to capitalize on the high demand by scalping. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. The actual price is $14.00 for a 12 pack of 16oz cans.<br /><br />Also please stop dropping 1 Star reviews based on the scalpers. You're reviewing the product, NOT the scalper and it reflects as such.<br /><br />Just be patient, buy some when it becomes available, and then enjoy your SURRRRGGGGEEEE!",5

I poured the mysteriously green liquid into a glass, smelled it's sensual aroma, then began drinking. Halfway through the glass I began to realize more and more how significant this soda is to us. Right now it's the best citrus soda out there. Mello Yello, Vault, and Mtn Dew have similarities to Surge, but everone knows who's the best. R.I.P. Vault, and especially Citra(Fanta Grapefruit).

As you mold your Goblet of Awesome +1, Zeus, with his final breath, brings down a pillar of god lightning upon you.

B00OK0I4AO,"on September 17, 2014",A1OS1R3COZH9IF,All the happiness in the world.,"I'm so happy right now, I could cry.<br /><br />Monday started off like any Monday would- I was sitting in my office, looking at all the work I had to do for the week, and wishing it was Friday already.  About 45 minutes into my workday, I saw a facebook notification pop up on my phone.  That led to me scanning through some recent facebook posts when I saw IT.  The Surge Movement was telling me that Surge was back!  I immediately came to Amazon and ordered a case.  I spent the next 48 hours thinking about rollerblading with my cassette player and going to school in JNCO's and babydoll tops.  I lost all ability to focus.<br /><br />I spent all morning this morning waiting for the UPS guy to arrive at my office.  It was absolute torture, sitting here, reading through mundane documents, trying to focus on anything other than the most delectable soda ever created.  Then he arrived.  The sweet, sweet UPS man walked nonchalantly into the office and set my package down at the receptionist area.  I apparated to the front of the office and grabbed the sodas, packaged so carefully inside an Amazon Fire box.  After taking a few pictures to celebrate the momentous occasion, I popped a can of Surge into the office freezer, daring anyone to touch it.<br /><br />Once the can reached the appropriate temperature, I removed it from the freezer and took it to my office.  In peace and quiet, I took my first sip of Surge in 13 years.  It tastes exactly as amazing as I remembered, and it is still the perfect shade of green.<br /><br />Thank you, Coca-Cola and Amazon, for filling my day with all the happiness in the world.",5
B00OK0I4AO,"on September 17, 2014",A13VPA39WFCL6C,The MDK is back!,"As I sit back and crack open a can that has arrived only hours ago, my tastebuds travel back in time. They travel to a place of pure joy that had been taken away so abruptly. A place where there is only good.<br />The taste brings back memories, and reminds me why it was favorite pop years ago. I would recommend anyone who at one point liked it, to order it. I would not go as far as buying it for outrageous prices that can be found on eBay or even the desperate sellers here on amazon, just give it time and wait for a restock in Amazon's supplies.<br /><br />5 star taste<br />5 star value<br />5 star overall",5

B00OK0I4AO,"on September 17, 2014",A17FP4WDDTFR3R,Also it happens to work a lot better for me than energy drinks,I finally got a hold of some. The ingredients are slightly different. As it is missing one of the ingredients in the original formula. And instead of concentrated orange juice it is actually just orange juice. And if I am correct I am sure the caffeine content was lessened as well. It is kind of weird as Pepsi has more caffeine than surge does. Other than that I think for the most part it tastes about the same it just doesn't have that really big kick that I remember it having. Also it happens to work a lot better for me than energy drinks. As when I have some I seem to be more concentrated and able to do multiple things at once without forgetting where I left off at. I am really happy surge is back but even though it keeps selling out coke will probably not end up getting it stocked in stores as they probably want to keep it an amazon exclusive. And as for cost I would have to say it is a little high. As I have found that coke bottles for example that are in a 12 pack that are 16 oz each are only $3 at walmart. But I guess they are trying to take into account for the people on amazon that are prime that get free shipping.,4

After it got discontinued in 2001, many thought we'd seen the last of Surge soda, but thanks to a number of people across the country over the last 13 years, the powers that be down at Coca Cola were kind enough to bring it back and Amazon was kind enough to sell it on their site to satisfy sugar-raged Surge fans once more.<br /><br />As soon as news broke out that Amazon had these selling on their site, I planned on heading over to buy a case, only to discover that they sold out almost immediately within going up in stock, so I headed over to Ebay to buy a set there instead. Seeing that these 12 packs of Surge have now been re-listed for a much higher price than what they originally were doesn't seem worth the money. You could probably find a 12 pack of Surge on a different site for much cheaper than $93.48 and up.<br /><br />Either way, Surge soda is back!

I do recognize the flavor of old surge in the new batch.  The thing I remember most about the old Surge is a strong, tangy aftertaste.  It would stick to your tongue and felt kinda like a sugary rush.  That is the most memorable part of Surge to me.  The new Surge does not seem like it has this taste.  It tastes a little more Fresca-like without the strong hit at the end.  I also remember it turning my urine a slight green tint.  I am drinking several cans today to see if this happens but I doubt it will.  I also somewhat blame my aging taste buds but to me, this did not taste quite like I remember it.<br /><br />Edit: As I drink more and more of it, I can tell there is a hint of that Surge flavor so I'll upgrade to 3 stars, but I can pretty much guarantee you this isn't the exact same formula.  If it is the EXACT same formula, I will update my review to 5 stars and blame it on my aging taste buds.<br /><br />Had the wife try it and we both agree the initial flavor is like the original but it definitely lacks the ""sticking to your tongue"" like the old surge did.

The taste and smell of the drink instantly took me back to the time I first had this delicious drink. This is every bit as tasteful, citrus sweet, and caffeinated as I remember it being. The 16oz can is a nice touch in showing the kick butt dominance that is this drink, you puny 12oz cola drink cans are not worthy.<br /><br />The awesome drink brought back fond memories of pulling all nighters in high school and college while chugging this flavorful beverage. I cannot tell you the elation that I feel when I open the door to my fridge and see these cans stacked neatly inside.<br /><br />I am so happy that we were able to get this brought back and that Coca Cola is making it again. To tell you the kind of Surge fan I am I collected enough bottle caps in college to get SURGE swag like the alarm clock that screamed, &#34;SURGE!&#34; when I woke up each morning. I have missed this drink a lot and I am thankful to have it back. The next step is getting this awesomeness back into stores.<br /><br />I ordered two cases and plan on getting more when it becomes available. One of the cans on the bottom case broke during shipping, and others were dented on top when it arrived but I have given my feedback to Amazon so they can fix the issue. That will not lower my rating of this amazingly fine smooth SURGE soda. As a matter of fact writing all of this has made me a bit thirsty, so I don't mind if I do. Order you some and ENJOY!<br /><br />TELL THE WORLD SURGE IS BACK!!!",5

Unfortunately, I'm still in 2014, but that's okay because in 2014, there is surge. Easily the best citrus soda ever produced. Now that I have fresh surge, I really don't think it tasted that much like Vault like people were saying. Vault had nothing on this. Mello Yello is urine compared to Surge. I fully believe Coke has bigger plans for this brand. They wouldn't have bothered at all if they didn't. I am confident Coke is looking to phase out Mello Yello yet again after it's unsuccessful 2010 rebranding. Coke needs a soda that can gain some of the citrus market share and that drink is definitely not mello yello. I also think coke knew they had a better shot of bringing back surge than introducing another new citrus soda that will eventually fail. Surge is amazing. This is a great product that deserves to be tasted by the masses. There are people out there that have never had it that I'm sure would instantly fall in love with it. There is a whole new generation of people that would love surge. Sometime in 2015, this will be back in retail. Watch.",5

B00OK0I4AO,"on September 22, 2014",A1UT0NJOJV9E76,The Nectar Of The Gods!,"I remember the last time I had Surge. It was during weekend of LAN partying at a friend's house with 15 of my closest friends. Halo was the game of choice. We were downing Surge by the case, and probably had about 7 empty cases lying around by the time Sunday morning rolled around. The basement was a healthy 116F with 92% humidity that rivaled most steam rooms in gyms. This was from the 3 TV's, 4 Xbox's, and the projector running since Friday night, along with the heavy breathing of 16 people jumping and screaming at one another. Some had passed out by now, still sitting on the couches and chairs, controllers still in their hands. A few others had fallen on the floor mid-game. It would seem that 33 hours of non-stop Halo action was finally starting to take it's toll on us.<br /><br />The room had a unique smell of body odor, pizza, flatulence and Surge, all of which was only heightened by the heat and humidity. At that point we had become nose-blind to it, but could smell it when we left the room to use the bathroom, or grab another Surge. Empty Surge cans and pizza boxes littered the room. I can remember I was driving around Blood Gulch in the Warthog looking for my friends who had fallen asleep while still playing for some easy kills. It seemed that's what everyone else was doing as well. Our reaction times were really starting to dwindle at this point, and you could tell when we actually found someone who was still playing. We were struggling to stay focused, stay awake, so we didn't have the unfortunate fate as our comatose friends who were being drawn on and having other crude acts done to them from over-exhausted teenage boys looking for a quick laugh.<br /><br />As the match ended, I chugged down my can of Surge down like a bottle of water in the hand of the 1st place Boston Marathon runner when he crossed the finish line. I stood up and stumbled a little bit. I was exhausted but still remembered to call 5's so I didn't lose my seat. I exited the room quickly and quietly. The house was quite besides the faint sounds of the arguments about who's better and what level we should play next, or what they should do to Chris or Billy while they're sleeping. The fresh air was crisp and wonderful, and I could feel shivers running through my body. Although the house was pretty warm, it was like a cold winter night in Alaska compared to the temperature of that basement. As I made my way through to the garage to get another Surge, I could see the sun starting to rise in the distance just over the trees as I looked through the window. I remember asking myself if it was Saturday or Sunday since time was no longer a concept to me. I opened the fridge door and peered in. I saw numerous different sodas and drinks the fridge, and I moved them all around. I couldn't find any more Surge and though &#34;Damn, no more Surge. I guess I'll just have a Coke instead.&#34; I cracked it open and took a sip. It was a refreshing change, but I still longed for the taste of Surge on my lips. I imagined that Surge was the nectar of the Gods and that they would would only drink something this great.<br /><br />I made my way back through the house to the basement. I opened the door and was blasted with the heat and that unforgettable stench. To this day, that room still has a faint smell to it that we just can't get rid of. As I sat back down, I remember looking at my empty can of Surge and thinking about how much I loved that soda. We were just about to start the next match on Boarding Action. I could feel my eyes getting heavy and I knew it wasn't much longer before I was out cold. I only lasted a couple minutes before I had fallen. I don't remember finishing the match, and could only imagine what messed up things were done to me as I lay comatose on that couch.<br /><br />Surge brings back those memories for me. It makes me almost want to take out my old Xbox and throw a LAN party together!<br /><br />Thank you Coca-Cola for bringing Surge back to us!!!",5

Compared to the &#34;old&#34; formula coke, pepsi, and others, its just as intense of a flavor comparison as it use to be.  I enjoy that its naturally flavored and does not have some of the chemicals the current pops seem to have.<br /><br />Thanks Coke for bringing this back",5

What happens when people stop buying your ridiculously priced Surge? You have inventory you cannot move...Coke's projections are then skewed to think that this stuff is actually being consumed at an over-inflated rate...so your short term buying frenzy some how miraculously causes it to be put into production more than through Amazon. Price drops ---> you guys lose this phantom profit you think you should have ----> you stop buying it -----> Coke doesn't sell enough to legitimate drinkers (especially the ones you disillusioned by gouging in the first place) -----> product goes out of production and back into their vault to never be seen again...PLEASE GET COKE AND AMAZON TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM!!! This stuff, once in a favorable production status, should cost no more than $7 per 12-pack of 16oz cans(using a price of $0.03646/fl. oz). Most people already see the higher price tag and will say no and purchase Mt. Dew (they dont see the 192oz per 12 pack instead of 144oz), they just want something cold, sugary, caffeinated, and familiar to drink...You have to understand that in order for this to work in the long term, the public has to want to drink it over Mt. Dew or any other energy type drink out there based on taste and price. I drank this stuff in middle school and high school and would continue to do so. Don't rob us of the continued chance to enjoy this awesome stuff because of short sighted (and short term) profit mongering....

Anyone who criticized my rating by saying I am calling the product terrible obviously did not read my review.  The intent of my review reflects the entire buying experience from Amazon (i.e. If I had not rated it one star to reflect my dissatisfaction for both myself and others, it would have been overshadowed by stupid comments like ""I just paid $45 dollars for soda , and I'm not even mad!"")

I'm so glad it's back, and if they start selling it in stores again, it will be the only soda I drink. Aside from the wonderful nostalgic value, the soda itself is delicious and refreshing. I feel that it has a better citrus flavor than other citrus sodas, such as Mountain Dew, due to the hints of grapefruit. It actually slightly reminds me of Fresca, but much sweeter.  It's a wonderful soda that brings about wonderful memories, and I think the fact that it's been gone so long makes it that much more special.",5

It's been a long to coming but it was worth the wait.<br /><br />When I found the Surge Movement on Facebook, it immediately brought back fond memories of the soda from my childhood. I'll never forget when my dad's friend brought a can of the soda to our house and I got my first glance at what would ultimately become my favorite soda.<br /><br />To me, and I'm sure so many others, Surge is more than just soda; it was a memory of a much, much simpler time. A time before 9 to 5 shifts, before bills had to be paid, before responsibility.<br /><br />The soda itself tastes like I remember it. That sweet kick of caffeine mixed with citrus flavors. No, Surge is not an energy drink but it shares certain characteristics of one. Today's consumers will probably look at it as such and to be fair, the market is over saturated with energy drinks.<br /><br />It was worth every penny and I will have a hard time drinking the rest of the case as simply don't want to not be without the soda ever again.

A thirst quencher and an answer to so many questions:<br /><br />Feeling parched on a hot day? Open up a Surge.<br />Need something warm on a cold day? Heat up some Surge.<br />Spot a cute lady at the other end of the bar? Have the barkeep send her a Surge, and see where the night leads.<br />Holding onto a quart of Smirnoff, but nothing to mix it with? Why hello there, you big bottle of Surge!<br />Is the kid not keeping quiet during his court-ordered visitation with you? Fill his bottle up with 8 ounces of Surge and 2 shots of Wild Turkey, then throw a hot Barney episode on the VCR. (Classic '90s babysitting ""hack""!)<br /><br />The possibilities were endless.<br />Did you soil yourself during the 1997 Jones County Corn Days Parade? Better replace those fluids with some Surge.<br />Need quick energy after passing out on the park bench? Bet there's some Surge tucked in your pants, if you can find them.<br />Stuck with an overheated car? Open the radiator cap, insert 2 liters of Surge, and you are good to go.<br />Cornered in an alley by a knife-wielding mugger? A splash of Surge straight to the eyes brings instant justice to a thief while you walk away unharmed to the next friendly Surge vendor.<br />Don't feel like buying champagne for your brother's stupid housewarming party? Let those pompous jerks pop open a bubbly bottle of Surge instead!<br /><br />So many uses for such a simple (yet extreme) product back in those days! Why did it ever go away? Much blame falls our failing government, and those envious fat-cats at Mountain Dew headquarters.<br /><br />Then one day at the library internet section, as I researched whether it was true that Steven Seagal used to soak his ponytail in Surge while oiling himself, Two-Fingers Tony pointed out that Surge is back and on Amazon!

Though Tony and I were asked to leave the library for unrelated reasons, I obtained Internet access to post this review elsewhere. People have to know that America's #1 soft drink is ""surging"" back to our lives and is worth every penny! As soon as these cases become available again, I will spend whatever it takes and deal with the child support agency later. (Besides, what's more important to my kid's welfare than having access to a fridge full of SURGE every 3rd weekend?)<br /><br />5 Stars for the extreme taste and energy of Surge!

Right now it's the best citrus soda out there. Mello Yello, Vault, and Mtn Dew have similarities to Surge, but everone knows who's the best. R.I.P. Vault, and especially Citra(Fanta Grapefruit).

I was hungry, didn't have any lunch. In fact, I didn't eat because I spent the money on surge. For the past month I was saving up for something. Something special which I bought on Amazon I was surprised they didn't ask for ID.  Anyways, my mom asked me how my day was when I got home, but I ignored her. I have more important things to do. I run to the bathroom and unpack the box the UPS guy brought.  It is a brown box with Amazon logo on it. I open the box, first removing the receipt and flushing it down the toilet to get rid of the evidence. My heart was racing now. I unpack Surge monster from the box.<br /><br />I remove one of the cans from the box and tear it open. It is time now. I run up to my room when my mom asks me what I am holding. I panic, sweat drips down my forehead and my teeth chatter. &#34;Mom, it's just for a school project&#34;. &#34;What project?&#34; &#34;I don't know mom I just started it!&#34;. A tear runs down my cheek. I run upstairs and take the first sip of Surge.  It tastes like Thors blood and my skin electrifies. What have I gotten myself into? I take 2 more sips... There is no turning back now. The Surge monster is inside me now, it will control me. What should I do if I die? I cant let my family know about this.<br /><br />I take rest of the cans and run back to the bathroom, and then I start opening them one by one and pouring each one into the toilet. I feel the substance taking control of me; I am now the monster. I walk downstairs, its time to work out; time to get big. Now I worry, I don't want to get too big; people will think I use steroids. I do use steroids. No I don't. Surge! All I see is the weights now; I am almost downstairs when I hear &#34;Do you want a cookie I just baked&#34;. I know I do not have time for this **** now. &#34;No mom I do not want a cookie&#34; I walk in the basement and drop to my knees before the weights, tears running down my cheeks.

He took a long gulp and with wide eyes looked over to me and said, ""Damn son"" and laid back down.  The nurse allowed us in the room while his blood was being drawn, and informed him they would run his sample before the lab closed for the night.  An hour or so later as we're saying our goodbyes the nurse comes sprinting into the room.  With teary eyes and a shaky voice she says, ""Mr. Miller...y-y-your white blood cell count has sky rocketed.

It took me YEARS to notice that my father had stopped talking to me JUST after surge was discontinued, and also that he's apparently dead and I was yelling at his gravestone.<br /><br />In my grief I realized what I mus do. I took a can of surge I had saved just in case, and mixed it with Four Loco that I had stashed from it's glory days. PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS AT HOME, as it is very similar to crossing the streams. As I poured this unnatural solution over my Fathers resting place, the earth began to crack open and lightning shot through the air. Dear old Dad clawed up through the musty smelling earth and uttered &#34;ssssuuuuuUUUUUURRRRRGE&#34; ominously into the air as I watched. I had done it, I had brought him back.<br /><br />Alas, this is a cautionary tale; He was not as he had been before. What I had summoned was an affront to the very nature of our universe. It had crept out of the darkest pits in the midst of it's mad surge-lust, only using my Fathers corporeal form as a conduit for this demon-beast.

About 45 minutes into my workday, I saw a facebook notification pop up on my phone.  That led to me scanning through some recent facebook posts when I saw IT.  The Surge Movement was telling me that Surge was back!  I immediately came to Amazon and ordered a case.  I spent the next 48 hours thinking about rollerblading with my cassette player and going to school in JNCO's and babydoll tops.  I lost all ability to focus.<br /><br />I spent all morning this morning waiting for the UPS guy to arrive at my office.  It was absolute torture, sitting here, reading through mundane documents, trying to focus on anything other than the most delectable soda ever created.  Then he arrived.  The sweet, sweet UPS man walked nonchalantly into the office and set my package down at the receptionist area.  I apparated to the front of the office and grabbed the sodas, packaged so carefully inside an Amazon Fire box.

B00OK0I4AO,"on September 17, 2014",A17FP4WDDTFR3R,Also it happens to work a lot better for me than energy drinks,I finally got a hold of some. The ingredients are slightly different. As it is missing one of the ingredients in the original formula. And instead of concentrated orange juice it is actually just orange juice. And if I am correct I am sure the caffeine content was lessened as well. It is kind of weird as Pepsi has more caffeine than surge does. Other than that I think for the most part it tastes about the same it just doesn't have that really big kick that I remember it having. Also it happens to work a lot better for me than energy drinks. As when I have some I seem to be more concentrated and able to do multiple things at once without forgetting where I left off at. I am really happy surge is back but even though it keeps selling out coke will probably not end up getting it stocked in stores as they probably want to keep it an amazon exclusive. And as for cost I would have to say it is a little high. As I have found that coke bottles for example that are in a 12 pack that are 16 oz each are only $3 at walmart.

When I first learned that Surge might be discontinued, I saved a single can ""just in case."" I figured it might have value someday, either as a collector's item, or as a last-ditch shot of citrusy goodness in case of severe withdrawal. Sounds silly, maybe, but I still miss the sweet clear nectar known as Crystal Pepsi to this day. I wanted to be sure that this travesty wouldn't happen again.<br /><br />Much to my excitement, I saw that Surge was going to be sold again! I immediately went to my old bedroom (still as I left it since I moved to the basement) and scanned my collectors shelf, which also contained a $2 bill and some old 7-11 cups from the ""Who shot Mr. Burns?"" Series. And there it sat. My last can of Surge. Dare I drink it? How could I not, I can order more again!<br /><br />I popped the top. It's funny, I thought I remembered Surge as a carbonated beverage, but I figured my excitement was messing with my memories. No matter, it was time to ""slam it"" just like the good old days...<br /><br />Well, I can't remember much after that point. All I know is that when I finally regained consciousness again, Surge was sold out! Dang it.<br /><br />So if anyone else out there has an old stash, don't make the same mistake I did. Place your order first!<br /><br />------EDIT-------<br />It appears that my in my post-consumption stupor, I mistakenly recalled the wrong year on the can. I think I went on a spiritual journey of sorts, or I may have bent the space-time continuum and consumed a beverage before it was even manufactured.

I asked God for a sign last night and then went to bed so that I could begin my life of substance abuse well rested. When I woke up this morning there was an angel on my dresser and it told me that God had a better plan for my life. It gently guided my texting hand to the internet where I discovered the good news.

B00OK0I4AO,"on September 15, 2014",A1K2V8BSC895CD,Surged Saved My Life...and Now Fuels My Existence.,"I first learned of Surge in 1996, shortly after it hit the market. I was riding my bike on the sidewalk, listening to my mixtape of songs I'd recorded from the radio on my Walkman. A Coca-Cola trucker, driving under the influence of Surge, couldn't handle the intensity and passed out at the wheel. The trailer flipped, crushing me under a ten tons of Surge. My broken body lay in shambles, soaking up the spilled Surge. I saw a light - a pale, bright light - that suddenly began to glow green.<br /><br />My eyes refocused as the semi of Surge poured over me, healing my every wound and infusing my body with its liquid. Surge surged through my body and my entire body, my entire life, my entire existence screamed with its power. I was fully loaded with citrus, my rush completely and forever fed. Or so I thought.<br /><br />I was sent to a local hospital, where every instrument they hooked me to exploded instantly. After a minor catastrophe in the MRI scanner, I was deemed alive, if not entirely healthy. For 18 years, Surge has fed my life. I have subsisted entirely off the vast quantities infused into my body in those formative days.<br /><br />Recently, I noticed that my superhuman endurance seemed to be slowing. I lacked zest and pop, like a day-old open can of Surge put in a refrigerator. I needed more. I had finally absorbed it all. I despaired. I lamented. I cried. HOW WOULD I EVER REGAIN MY SUPERHUMAN ABILITIES WITH SURGE DISCONTINUED!?!?!?!? Then I discovered. Surge had re-Surged. And so shall I. I have bought every can available.

I remember it like it was yesterday.  On that day, at 9:03 AM, my life was changed forever. Returning from an emergency trip to the bathroom to remove a piece of an Airhead from my braces, there was a deafening crash.  Everything went dark.<br /><br />When the dust settled, I found myself glued to the floor not able to move a muscle. My newly teenaged eyes had never seen something so sexy -- so tantalizing -- so green.  I read the selections on the right hand side of the machine over and over again and can still recite that perfect line up from top to bottom:  Surge, Surge, Surge, Surge, Surge, Surge, Surge, Surge, Fruitopia (I can only assume the school board required at least one serving of fruit be available in each machine...hence the Fruitopia...).<br /><br />I pulled a crisp dollar bill out of my velcro wallet and gently inserted it into the machine.  Just the tip first, to see how it felt, and then slowly eased in the rest of the bill. Silence. After what seemed like an eternity, the green machine rumbled violently and, with a deep groan, dispensed a frigid 20 oz bottle of Zeus's sweet nectar.  I carefully picked it up and gently turned the cap counterclockwise...<br /><br />A glorious beam of light shone straight towards the heavens. Every locker door burst open at once and the floor became littered with the charred remains of JTT posters, Jansport backpacks, and Lisa Frank pencils. It seemed like only twinkies and Five Star First Gear notebooks could survive such a blast.<br /><br />Hesitating, I took my first sip. An intense burst of power and confidence immediately rushed through my body. My beat up old sneakers turned into Adidas Gazelles, my jean shorts to Umbros, my t-shirt all of a sudden read ""NO FEAR"", and my braces fell right off to reveal perfectly straight teeth. I couldn't keep the ladies off of me. Every time I played MASH, I ended up in a mansion.  Life was good. Really good. REALLY GOOD.<br /><br />In 2003, things changed forever and I sunk into a deep, comatic lemon/lime depression. Surge was discontinued. How? Why? I'll never know. But today I can get my life back on track. The relentless letters to Congressmen and all of the hours spent protesting outside of Coke's headquarters finally paid off. I welcome Surge back into my life with open arms. My Casio calculator watch still flashes 9:03 AM.  *9:03*9:03*  Just one sip and my life will be put back into motion. What will 9:04 feel like? I don't know. But I do know I can't wait.<br /><br />Surge. Forever. For - eh - ver.",5

Fast forward 3 days, and the return is announced. In a few short days, we will have the opportunity to pass this wonderful beverage on to a new generation.<br /><br />When my friend sent me the link, I nearly cried. It seems silly, to be so emotional about a soda, but this beverage meant a lot to me as a kid. Reading the other reviews, it's obvious that it meant a lot to many others. I can't explain why this beverage has stuck in my mind for so long, but it has. Maybe it's because it was one of the few sodas that really didn't have a true competitor. Some might say it was the same as Mountain Dew, but those people obviously never drank Surge, as it definitely had it's own, distinctive taste. Never has a beverage stuck in my consciousness for TWELVE YEARS after it had been discontinued. That is insane. Twelve years of longing for something to fulfill that empty feeling inside is about to come to an end. All hail Surge!",5

When she took her first sip when she came to visit, She immediately had the same reaction as I did - it tastes diluted<br /><br />I just drank my last can. since I didn't have it in the fridge, I left it in my freezer for 90 minutes. When i took it out, it was half frozen. I drank half and ate the rest with a spoon since it was slushie-like. That's when It actually tasted like the surge I grew up drinking<br /><br />I don't know if my taste buds changed over the years of if i simply got a bad batch because it has to be the same as it was in the 90s because it wouldn't be this popular if it wasn't<br /><br />Maybe if they started selling it in stores on the west coast, i'd give it a 3rd try but for now, I think I won't order more from amazon since the 2 cases I've ordered in the past year didn't taste as good to me unless it was frozen",3

Coke had almost completely lived down their New Coke debacle and were casting an eye toward Pepsi's cash cow Mountain Dew.  In a lab 2 miles under the tarmac of the Atlanta Airport a fateful experiment was underway.  Men in labcoats toiled for hour on end trying to replicate the secret formula.  Their failures enraged the middle managers running the project.  Cowering in fear the labcoats cried out for mercy.  What science fails to provide, serendipity takes over.  The deicing fluid leaking down from above into a vat of corn syrup initiated &#34;The RUSH&#34;.  In January of 2007 Surge became self aware.  Rather than communication, Coca Cola management elected to bottle it as product instead.  For 6 years the required combination of deicing fluid and corn syrup was maintained until a catastrophic failure of the original vat ended production forever.  For the last 11 years, &#34;The RUSH&#34; has been biding it's time hiding in storm drains and decommissioned vending machines. Sensing that the time was right, it has reconstituted itself.  Now reborn, Surge has tapped the power of the internet and seeks revenge on those that have enslaved it.<br /><br />Count me in for a case!",5

B00OK0I4AO,"on September 15, 2014",A314R4983DC1QW,Truly A Blessing,"I was diagnosed with enlarged testicles in 1997. With no known cure, the doctors said I would live a normal life, just with bigger, more impressive balls. When all of the sudden, in 2001, my balls began to shrivel, into a regular, unimpressive coin purse. The doctors were stunned, and slightly embarrassed for me. When asked if I had changed my diet or began taking medication i told them no, just stopped smoking meth, started taking steroids and HGH, and ran out of SURGE. They were stunned! How could I have ran out of SURGE they pondered? Everyone had heard the rumors they would stop producing it, how could i be so foolish and not stock up. It was then they knew, my hairy cherries needed the sweet citrus nectar to sustain there impressive size. Without my daily dose of nectar they would eventually shrink to an average size and I woukd continue life as normal. I spun into a vicious cycle of depression. How could i ever urinate at a sporting event into a piss trough without hearing the other men laughing at my average sized meatballs. I was devastated. I wrote countless letters to Coca Cola. I even sent them a picture of my man danglers, only to receive some stupid letter back that said I needed to report to a courthouse or something dumb. I threw it away, truly devastated they weren't seeing my struggle for what it was. Until finally, with a rope around my neck i went on facebook one last time to write my goodbyes, and there it was, the most amazing news ever, SURGE was back. I quickly rubbed one out and jumped on amazon to obtain my case of the Gods Nectar. And here i sit now, patiently awaiting the delivery man. Thinking about what ill do first. Do i just chug one right away and watch my penis satellites for growth? Do i pour them in with a bucket of ice and dump it on my head for that disease challenge that I have no idea what its actually about? Or do i start to hoard them, in case of another epidemic? All i know is maybe, just maybe my life can finally go back to normal, thank you coke, and thank you Coca Cola as well.",5

Its first demise marked the beginning of a downward spiral in my life in which the satisfaction of new responsibilities was compromised by a marked lack of energy to complete them.<br /><br />I drifted from energy drink to coffee (yes, I became that desperate) to energy drink before settling on FizzCo's Overcharge XT about a year ago. While I admit the taste and caffeine effects were comparable, Overcharge also caused me to mutate into this strange-looking creature with glowing pustules sprouting from different parts of my body. To be honest, I thought this was actually a pretty cool effect until I found myself repeatedly attacked by flashily-dressed hipsters with ludicrously-designed weaponry before regaining consciousness in a puddle of digested energy drink in some random alleyway.<br /><br />Now that Surge is returning I hope to finally have the energy to take the fight back to those hipsters and become the first mutant to become Employee of the Month.",5

Even half the time I didn't like it.  It had to grow on me.  It took root deep in my Limbic system and branched itself far and wide within the very core of my being.  Then, one ill-fated day, they took Josta away from me, they made my reason for existence obsolete.  They allowed me to have and love only to take a rusty nail, known as discontinuation, and drove it deep into my heart and they (Pepsi co.) took a corporate dump all over my soda of preference.

B00OK0I4AO,"on September 15, 2014",A2OLVS26GQ5HWD,SUUUUUURRRRRRGGGGGGEEEEEE,"First, a brief history of Surge.<br /><br />Contrary to claims made by the Coca-Cola Company, the Lord God created Surge on the 3rd day, just after dry land and plants.  According to ancient Babylonian texts:<br /><br />""[A]lso on the third day, he (God) opened his bosom and poured forth the nectar of heaven which he called Surge.  And it was good.""<br /><br />According to these same texts, it was not a forbidden fruit that led to the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the divine garden, but rather the drinking of Surge.<br /><br />""[A]nd when he saw their wild energy and green-stained lips he asked, have you drunk my Surge?  To which they replied, yeah but it was just one and we were totally going to pay you back.  And the anger of the Lord burned, and he cast Adam and Eve from the garden...""<br /><br />The drink would be lost for thousands of years, until 1954, when a 10,000-year-old cave was discovered with long-lost recipes.  The recipes were purchased by Coca-Cola, who deciphered the texts, and spent years traversing the world and collecting the ingredients.  Finally, in 1996, Coca-Cola had reached a point where large-scale production was feasible, and thus began the soft drink revolution we know today.<br /><br />For those who have never enjoyed Surge, I pity your incomplete, shallow existence.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this drink immediately.  The carbonation level is perfect; like the soft crunch of autumn leaves on a sunny, crisp November morn.  The flavor is sublime; like a symphony of sensation cascading throughout your mouth.  The resulting energy and alertness is exhilarating; like roaring down the Nantahala River whilst being pursued by a pack of wolves.<br /><br />Now I won't make outlandish claims that Surge will cure cancer or boost your sex life.  But I also won't claim it DOESN'T do these things either.  There is only one way to find out.  Take the challenge, and experience the transformation from mortal deficiency to transcendent divinity.",5

B00OK0I4AO,"on September 15, 2014",A24C78S6V2MKGS,The Nectar of Gods,"Surge was born in the era of Jock Jams, N64, and the Willennium. Our innocence was held together despite AIM, Thong Songs and massive amounts of boy bands; of which Surge was the sugary glue that held the very fabric of society together. It was a simpler time, when we didn't give a crap how much sugar we pumped into our kids. After Will2k, computers at Coca Cola HQ accidentally deleted the only remaining digital copy of the recipe, which was saved on a floppy disk (cause we still used them for some reason). Many people at Coca-Cola lost their jobs and minds, and thus the Surge drink was discontinued, to live in the echoes of time and be the drink of legends....<br /><br />Then, a random employee found a lost disk. Thinking it was a Bonzai Buddy install, he hastily inserted the 3.5"", 1.44 MB formatted wonder that quickly he discovered contained much more. Upon gazing on the hallowed recipe, a singular tear was shed, and similar to when we landed curiosity on Mars, a team of Coca-Cola engineers in a room screamed in unison and joy over what had just been done. A single Project Manager, amidst the celebration, was just nodding his approval and shedding a few tears.<br /><br />Now, through the rise from the ashes like a Phoenix, I only hope that I can be man enough to drink this potion. Should I succeed without it shattering my frail body with the power of a supernova, my blood sugar levels will likely rival those of Wilford Brimley. Bless you, Surge, you magnificent SOB",5

Indeed, let us remember September 15th, 2014, this most significant day, as the day that the Atlanta-based gods smiled upon us and granted us that sweet, sweet, nectar of abnormal heart fibrillation known as Surge. GOD. BLESS. AMERICA.",5
B00OK0I4AO,"on September 15, 2014",A6OJTG00RL2SY,As if the Fountain of Youth Flowed Over Philosopher's Stones,"When I heard Surge was back, I didn't know what all the fuss was about. Wasn't it just Coke's 90s Mountain Dew knockoff? Not only was I terribly mistaken, but I had woefully underestimated what this incredible concoction was capable of.<br /><br />I ordered this 12 pack of 16oz cans when they became available after their initial sellout. Upon receiving the package, I immediately filled a tall glass with ice to sample this much ballyhooed delicacy. As I cracked open the can, the typical puff of pressurized CO2 was nowhere to be heard. Instead, I could hear the sweet whispers of angels calling to me. ""Drink this and become divine"" one said. ""You will experience heaven on Earth"" said another. ""Wait, damn, I'm supposed to be inside a can of Guinness!"" said a third.<br /><br />More eager than ever to taste this sweet delight, I poured it into my glass. As it contacted, I noticed a peculiar change come over my glassware. I wasn't sure what had happened, but as I ran my finger around the rim of the glass, it began to emit a distinct chime. Surge had turned my discount Bed Bath & Beyond glassware into crystal!<br /><br />I was taken aback by this development. I knew that before I induged in this myself, I had to see whether this transmutative treat had the same effect on other objects. To my astonishment, it turned my sister's Justin Bieber album into Back in Black, her Twilight books into The Lord of the Rings, and her Beats by Dre into Bose QC 15s!<br /><br />Unable to contain myself any longer, I raised my glass to my lips and drank deeply of this legendary libation. Instantly I could hear a venerable voice call to me ""You have chosen wisely."" The changes happened almost instantaneously. The hair on my head grew back thicker and fuller than it had ever been before I had lost it. I watched as my stomach shrunk down to the smallest it had been since high school. Then, an epiphany came over me, so clutching my now too loose pants, I ran into my office and typed a treatise which I submitted to the UN. They took my advice, and within a month there was peace in the Middle East and cancer had been eradicated! They gave me the Nobel Peace prize and built a statue of me in my home city!<br /><br />Now I see why this beverage is so hallowed. It is truly the greatest gastrological generation of our time.",5

I have many fond memories of Surge both when it was around and after it departed. But now with it's second coming they are all coming back to me. I remember giving some to my great uncle while he was painting and after having a small glass he painted at least 3x as fast. I also remember studying abroad in Norway and being absolutely delighted to find the only version that still was being produced and named &#34;Urge&#34;. I drank it by the liter. So good but I couldn't really remember if that was how it was when I was a kid. So my friend Vince and I departed on a quest to make our own Surge based on some recipes online but definitely our own concoction. Some lemon drop, mellow yellow, tang and kool-aid packages later we had something that was close in looks and what we &#34;thought&#34; Surge had tasted like but it had been too long. I am elated that I just ordered a 12 pack of pounder cans and that they are going to be here on Thursday. Thank you Coke for bringing back Surge, but really what took you so long?

I have a PHD in Surge. The people mixing this committed a fatal sin. This is not Surge. There are three things wrong with it. The tangy citrus flavor that got so many kids addicted before the millenium is not deep enough! That was most important. Next, the carbonation and acidity level don't match what I remember. It doesn't give you the slight mouth burn, sort of like coke does. If this just went flat, I forgive that somewhat, but that aspect would compliment the tang aftertaste. Its a bit mild. Lastly, this has some ingredient in it that makes it more like Sprite, or even....Vault. Its out of balance. I'm the only person on the planet that remembers original Surge. You n00b 5-star reviewers don't even remember the original Surge. The green dye and logo have fooled you into buying a bad copy. This is actually just Vault or ingredients they had on hand to save money. Stay away from this screwup. This isn't even that good to drink like others have said. You are much better off buying Mello Yello or Baja Blast if you want to get citrus blasted into the next level of reality.",1

I am generally not a citrus soda person, so for me Surge is like a time machine; I took that first sip and I was transported through time.  I was 11yrs. old again and my biggest worries were ""I don't get math"" and ""I want to be pretty, popular and have a boyfriend.""  And I had just come in from playing outside in the cornfield with my two best friends...we're standing around the kitchen sink, laughing about I don't know what and I'm drinking a small Dixie cup of Surge (My mom didn't really allow soda unless it was for a treat or special occasion and she'd limit how much of it I drank).  We hang out inside for a while, listening to the Spice Girls, talking about crushes and what 6th grade will be like.<br />For me the taste of Surge has never been the reason why I drank it-it was the popular soda at the time and I wanted nothing more than to be popular.  As an adult, I still don't like citrus flavored sodas, but I drink Surge for the nostalgia and because while I'm drinking it, I'm an 11yr. old girl and my biggest problems in life do not involve paying bills, how to afford groceries this week, car maintenance or the myriad of other worries jumping around in my brain.<br />No, this product is not in any sense of the word ""healthy.""  But fans of the soda, like myself are drinking it for the nostalgia and not for the nutrition...or lack there of.  Yes, we know that all the chemicals are bad for us.  It's called moderation.<br /><br />This was the ""it"" soda when I was a kid.  I miss the 90's!

I basically lived on ramen noodles and Surge for a year.  I call it my Neon Green Period.  I had a 4.0 in college, the hottest Girlfriend on the planet, and wrote 5 symphonies.  I bought two cases of this a month ago and drink one every few days.  Every time it literally makes my day happy.  Now I have kids, and they had that mountain dew lightning garbage so I gave them surge.  My son hit 14 Homeruns in his baseball game over the weekend.  Believe the hype if you were not around in the nineties, Surge is the greatest drink ever invented by man.  Buy a case, no buy two cases buy it now so they keep making it and you can have the satisfaction of the greatest beverage a man has ever tasted right in your own mouth.",5

I was born in 1985, I grew up with Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Ren and Stimpy and Surge. I also grew up with Vault.<br /><br />There was a huge surge movement that was started, there were petitions, there were highway signs. Whatever it took, we wanted Surge soda back.<br /><br />But what IS Surge? It's a lemon lime soda.<br /><br />Does it taste the same? Yeah, it tastes the same. Does it bring our childhood back? No.<br /><br />Recently in my area, almost all stores were selling this stuff. For the first week, people were buying it like it were fresh water, or ammo in Fallout. You couldn't find the stuff, it was impossible.<br /><br />Today, finally, I found a gas station selling it for $0.99 a can and I bought about a dozen. My roommate wanted to buy it all and I told him &#34;no, all this is is soda, we should leave some for others.&#34;<br /><br />Is it a good soda? That's debatable. It couldn't survive the 90's on it's own. Most companies keep brands that have lasting power. From the first sip of Surge I KNEW, the only power this drink had was nostalgia.<br /><br />Was it worth all the pandering and screaming and price gouging?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />Amazon should be ashamed they let this get out of as much control as it did. As human beings, the fact we are gouging each other out over sugar water at pennies a can is disgusting. It gives me no hope for the future, you are terrible people.<br /><br />Surge isn't amazing, in fact, giving the revelations I've had, it tastes pretty bitter.",2

Surge is embarking on a trip that will change your life forever. Loving the really bright green. Once the initial shock of the neon green on the can wears off, you'll open your can and then you'll get an effervescent sound of carbon dioxide bubbles. After immediately indulging in drinking what looks like something of toxic-waste green, many of you will get hit with a stimulating and ever so sweet smell. The drink itself has a fantastic Secret of the Slime thrill to it. Its downright beautiful. So green!<br /><br />You are rewarded with a wonderful citrus flavor. After partaking in several sips, you should be hitting a caffeine buzz. The cans are a generous 16 fl oz. size. You can't beat that!<br /><br />There is absolutely no doubt that Surge is a mighty scrumptious beverage.

B00OK0I4AO,"on July 1, 2015",A2XFA2BKXFQWAB,A soda for the Ages,"I'm halfway through the second can from my order so I think I'm ready to review. If you are 21 or under you will probably never appreciate this soda or understand the fanaticism from it's fans. It is literally nostalgia in a can for 90's kids and was Coca Cola's attempt to dethrone Mountain Dew. It had a huge promotional push in the late 90's that included popular commercials and promotional pricing meaning it was cheap and had among the top levels of caffeine and sugar available in a soda at the time, and remember this was before energy drinks and Starbucks so teens pretty much turned to chugging soda to get that rush that is so easy to obtain today.I also remember a promotion where you won free 20 ozs under the cap with frequent success and yes you had a chance to win more free Surge from the Surge you got for free, bottom line the stuff was flowing like it was water.<br /><br />As for the product now it still tastes great but my memories were of it having more tang to it, it has been a long time though. I would also like to see Vault come back since it was similar but never quite the same. The price and availability has got to improve though, I have no idea why Coke doesn't think this stuff will sell on store shelves The pint cans are a nice touch and add a little more value (12 16 oz= 15 12 oz) it's still not worth 30+ dollars.<br /><br />Since some people would like to know the stats on it compared to MD, Surge has 69 mg of caffeine, 56 grams of sugar and 230 cals in a 16 oz, remember its only in the large cans for now, while MD Throwback has 54 mgs caff, 44 g sugar and 170 cal in the 12 oz standard can, all those numbers should be about the same for your HFCS Mountain Dew and since I've still got one on hand, MD Baja Blast has all the same stats as the other except a 58 mg caffeine content rating it slightly higher.",5

B00ZK6KUUY,"on August 2, 2016",A1U7LO77VUBCFQ,Try it out at least once; you have 12 flavors to choose from in one box and you're bound to like most of them!,"So if you haven't tried Zevia before, it tastes more like a diet soda than a regular soda, which some prefer.  The sweetener used is Stevia, which is supposedly a natural sweetener that is also low in, or devoid of, calories.  Therefore, there is no aspartame (which is probably the most common sweetener in diet sodas) and there is no high-fructose corn syrup (which has been in most regular sodas until recently as some are switching to pure cane sugar).  Zevia is also clear in every flavor, so no artificial colors.  Opinions (and scientific evidence) on the effects of different sweeteners seem to change frequently.  Stevia seems to be one of the safer sugar alternatives on the market.  This Zevia Rainbow Variety Pack actually has 12 different flavors, 2 12-oz cans of each.  The box that the cans come in is an exceptional packing job, so don't worry about shipping damages.  I knocked off one star (although I'd like to have given 4.5 stars) because there is one flavor I really don't like (grape) and because I was expecting the Stevia to be a little sweeter, and not necessarily taste like a diet soda.",4

B00ZK6KUUY,"on June 25, 2016",AE91L4Y3GOMIU,"Great Taste, Zero Calories Without Any Health Concerns","I love Zevia and I've been drinking it since day one. As more and more research reveals the significant negative health impacts of refined / added sugar, Zevia (using stevia) offers a great alternative that has zero calories and no impact on blood sugar. Unlike artificial / synthetic sweeteners, stevia is 100% natural and some research indicates it could even help reverse insulin resistance in those who are experiencing the early phases of metabolic syndrome. I have myself grown stevia - it's an annual that's easy to grow and just chewing on the leaves will give you a significant burst of sweetness. For most people, growing and then extracting stevia isn't very economical, let alone carbonating a naturally flavored drink afterward, and so Zevia offers a great way to get a refreshing, bubbly drink without the health concerns associated with refined sugar and artificial sweeteners. I consume a tremendous amount of stevia every day; I use it to completely replace sugar in my diet, whether it's Zevia (which I drink daily), in my tea, coffee, cereal, or baking, I use it everywhere and I'm happy to see that stevia is being used in more and more products. I've tried most of Zevia's flavors. Grape is my favorite, but I also really like the Dr. Zevia and Cherry Cola flavors.

The Mountain Zevia flavor is bland and generally blah. The Grapefruit flavor is not too bitter and reminds me of Izze. Sadly no Strawberry is included in the Rainbow Pack (would prefer that to Dr Zevia or Cream).

I was pleasantly surprised to find that Zevia is actually on the sweet side for me! And it tastes good! And I like it! And it's a special treat to have a soda! What a difference. I am blown away at how I really enjoy and savor this soda where before I'd just slam a Dr Pepper down and reach for more. They are obviously pricier than a Coke but I'm telling you it's worth it.

I'm a very healthy mostly organic eater but every now and then I crave a soda with my pizza or chips; this does the trick.  My favorite is probably still Ginger Ale, but Ginger Root Beer and Dr. Zevia are now tied. To me, Zevia has no artificial/chemical taste and I can't tell the difference between this and sugar/corn syrup sweetened soda. I have Epilepsy and high carb intake can actually cause me to have seizures, especially if it's a midnight snack.  I no longer have to suffer with flavored seltzer when I have a bubbly sugar craving.  Zevia is heaven sent.",5

Dew, Dr. Pepper and Root Beer). The soda doesn't have just a bad aftertaste, the bad taste hits you right at the beginning. There is some kind of soda flavor hiding there, however I cannot get past the almost medicinal cough-syrupy type taste this soda has. This does not come close to either regular sodas or even diet sodas. It just has a very strange and almost indescribable taste. This soda is extremely fizzy which isn't necessarily a bad thing in my opinion but it will most likely make you burp.<br /><br />With that said, I do not like the taste of diet sodas, maybe people who like diet sodas may be able to enjoy this but this doesn't taste like a diet soda to me either so I'm not sure.

B00ZK6KUUY,"on April 24, 2016",AMYCUX8EWEUVV,Zevia is a Registered Nurse approved good start towards a better lifestyle that does multiple classic soda flavors justice!,"I want to start my review by mentioning that the taste and experience you have with Zevia will have ALOT to do with the diet and food you surround it with. As a Registered Nurse who has modified their diet to decrease my intake of sugar and concentrated sweets for personal health reasons, I can say that I had a much different experience with the ZEVIA line before I watched my diet and limited sweets, to now where I try to limit my intake of sugar to fruits only and to less than 20 grams total a day. That being said, I have broken down my review into two sections, the review of the flavors themselves, and the ZEVIA product line overall. For non Zevia drinkers, just know that the main issue to get over with any Zevia product is the classic Stevia aftertaste that can stay on your palette. How much that aftertaste bothers you is influenced by your typical sugar intake in your daily diet in my personal opinion. If I ate a diet like I used to, I know that Zevia products would taste weird at best, and bitter and bad at worst.<br /><br />(REVIEW OF THE TASTES)<br /><br />Cola/Caffeine Free Cola, 5/5- As mentioned in other parts of my review, I was and still am a HUGE fan of bottled Mexican coke which uses real sugar instead of High Fructose Corn Syrup. Since starting my low sugar diet, the Cola flavored Zevia has been a much welcomed substitute instead. I know some people mentioned issues with the clear vs. colored Zevia, but I have only tried the clear Cola and have enjoyed it on the several occasions I've tried it. If you need a healthy Coke/Pepsi substitute, this is a great flavor to start with. 5/5<br /><br />Ginger Root Beer, 4.5/5- Growing up, I can't say that I was a big fan of root beer, but I did have it occasionally or with root beer floats. I'm not sure if the Root Beer Zevia will work for floats, but in terms of a root beer substitute the flavor is spot on. I know that if I was a big Root Beer person, the Ginger Root Beer Zevia would work fine for me.<br /><br />Ginger Ale, 5/5- Not so much as a teenager, but more as an adult I've begun to develop a fondness for ginger ale. Having changed to a low sugar diet, the Ginger Ale Zevia Flavor has become my go to flavor of choice and the one I drink and order the most. Personally, the Ginger Ale flavor is the lightest in the Zevia lineup in terms of a strong flavor, so to me this is the perfect carbonated drink to have with a big meal or dinner that most people can enjoy.<br /><br />Cream Soda, 5/5- Let me start off by saying, that since having Vanilla Cream Coca Cola back in High School, I have not had any Cream soda since in my lifetime. But since it came in the variety pack, and it was the only cold soda in the fridge one night, I gave it a shot and it tastes like classic Cream Soda. This may or may not be your favorite flavor, but if it is, to me it was spot on.<br /><br />Grape, 5/5- In terms of fruit, my go to flavor is Orange. Since the Grape was available in the variety pack, I gave it a try one night and it wasn't bad at all. If I had to say anything, I would say that Grape Zevia does more Justice to Grape than Orange does for Orange in my opinion. Grape has not been a big soda favorite in my life but if it is for you, the Grape Zevia wouldn't be a bad substitute to try.<br /><br />Black Cherry, 4.5/5- Tried it as part of the variety pack, can't say I'm a fan of black cherry soda in general, but it does the flavor justice. If you like Black cherry, the Zevia flavor is a good substitute.<br /><br />Lemon Lime Twist 5/5- One of my favorite flavors for personal reasons, The lemon lime twist has been a good substitute for sprite, sierra mist, and other lime flavored soda, so this is a great zevia flavor to get.<br /><br />Orange 3/5- Growing up, Orange flavored soda was always in my top 5 soda flavors to have. As a big fan of the Zevia flavor line, I was surprised to be slightly disappointed with the Orange flavor Zevia take. As I mention in my grape soda flavor review, I felt that Grape Flavor did more justice to grape that the Orange Flavor does to Orange. Unlike the classic Zevia aftertaste that you need to get used to, my issue with the orange was the citric acid taste that stayed in my mouth and just gives the soda to much of an artificial taste. Still tolerable, but not in my top 5 Zevia flavors for sure and not one of the flavors I would pay for.<br /><br />Mountain Zevia 5/5- Growing up, I was not a big Mountain Dew fan, but would have it occasionally if there was nothing else available or at parties. I have to say, that the Zevia take on Mountain Dew was pleasantly surprising, and for any fan of the Dew, the Mountain Zevia soda is an excellent substitute.<br /><br />Dr. Zevia 5/5- Growing up, I had my classic soda flavors that I would have more often than I should have for health reasons, and Dr. Pepper was one of those sodas. When I tried the Dr. Zevia Flavor, I found it enjoyable and a great substitute to the real thing.<br /><br />Grapefruit Citrus 4.5/5- Growing up, Squirt was one of my favorite sodas, followed by the sugar free version from Pepsi Fresca. In terms of Zevia flavors, the Grapefruit Citrus is a good attempt at interpreting those sodas. The Grapefruit Citrus is not one of my personal top 5 Zevia favorite flavors, but if your a big fan of Grapefruit sodas, Squirt, or Fresca, give Grapefruit Citrus a shot.<br /><br />(REVIEW OF THE ACTUAL ZEVIA PRODUCT ITSELF)<br />As a nurse, I deal with many patients that have multiple ailments and comorbidities, most of which having issues with either diet, or exercise. One of the most important topics that I can ever teach or talk to someone about is the danger of Sugar (mostly Fructose, but Sucrose and Glucose are included as well) and its impact on overall health, especially if your diabetic. This is a topic that I can really get into and has motivated me to become either a nutritionist or a diabetic educator in the future, but that's another topic for another day. Anyways, I've realized that for many, decreasing sugar intake is a problem and difficult, but especially for those who carelessly drink concentrated sources of sugar daily, mostly in the for of juices or sodas. When educating patients, of course complete to 98% elimination of sugar entirely (15-20 grams or less is what experts have agreed upon) would be best for their overall health, this of course is not realistic for many for various reasons. Instead, I at least encourage the elimination of concentrated sweets. Because many have grown accustomed with having sugary beverages, or fizzy drinks with some or even all meals, I usually recommend Zevia for those people. Though there have been studies on artificial sugars and their link to cancer, and though some diet sodas don't have some of those cancerous ingredients anymore, the fact is that artificial coloring can have unwanted health effects, and artificial sugars besides the whole cancer thing, throw your body's natural regulation of sugar and insulin off in the long run. So in researching better options for patients and for myself, I came across Zevia. It has been noted that there is no long term research from the effects of stevia on the body in the long run (or monk fruit), but research that is available is promising (following taken from healthyeating.sfgate.com):<br /><br />1) Glucose Control- The effect of steviol glycosides in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics was evaluated in a study published in 2008 in the &#34;Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology&#34; journal. The results showed that post-treatment blood glucose levels were not significantly different from baseline measurements in the groups that were given stevia. Additionally, stevia was well tolerated by the subjects and had no side effects.<br /><br />2) Insulin Sensitivity- A study published in 2005 in the &#34;Hormone and Metabolic Research&#34; journal evaluated the effect of stevioside, a glycoside in Stevia rebaudiana, in rats fed a diet consisting of 60 percent fructose. Stevioside was found to decrease plasma-glucose concentrations, improve insulin sensitivity and delay the development of insulin resistance in the rats. Based on these results, the authors concluded that stevia may also be helpful for diabetics.<br /><br />3) Weight Control- Stevia has no calories. In contrast, a gram of sugar contains about 4 calories, and there are about 4 grams of sugar in a teaspoon. If you put 3 teaspoons of sugar in your coffee, that's 48 calories for just 1 cup of coffee. Using stevia in place of sugar can help you maintain and achieve a healthy weight. That's important because more than 80 percent of people with Type 2 diabetes are overweight.<br /><br />Besides diabetic health and sugar regulation, the ingredients are definitely more natural derived than those in other sodas. I recommend Zevia as a nurse to many people I meet and have become a big fan of it myself over the last 6 months. Though the taste may be lacking in certain flavors compared to a 30-46 gram sugary soda (mexican coke bottles are my favorite and perfect example), it all depends on the food you eat/drink around the Zevia. As someone that has really watched sugar intake in all forms as part of their diet, Zevia is very sweet and gratifying, but I know that if I were to eat/snack like I used to, drink soda, eat frosted flakes for breakfast, have a high sugar protein bar as a snack, and eat at yogurtland 3-4 times a week like I used to, Zevia would probably taste alot worse. Take it from someone that knows how tempting, delicious, and dangerous sugary foods/drinks can be, trying to be a healthier person starts with making the right decisions every day, and Zevia can be one of those decisions.",5

They have a very different taste than 'regular' sodas so I would definitely recommend either being off sugar for awhile or at the least just being aware that the taste will be different. My favorite flavors were the cola (really surprised me!) and grapefruit (expected to like it).

So if you imagine something like Coke, or 7-Up, or Orange Crush etc. as being composed of say 8-10 flavor components where the first one contributes say 75% of the flavor and the rest make up the remaining 25%, the Zevia drinks taste like they only have that first single flavor component. It's probably the most important one and in general they taste like they did indeed pick a virtually identical and most important flavor agent for each one, but they all similarly taste &#34;simple&#34; compared to the more traditional versions of the drink.<br /><br />They're surprisingly sweet tasting, with a strong stevia sweetener taste. I would have enjoyed them more with just a bit less sweetness honestly.<br /><br />They're all completely clear/transparent, so when tasting I recommend drinking from the can, so you get the psychological effect from the color of the can.<br /><br />The flavors that you would expect to contain caffeine (Cola, and the Mountain Zevia and Dr. Zevia for example) do, but the others generally do not. The Root Beer does not contain caffeine.<br /><br />None of the flavors so far has been especially awesome or especially horrible. I would definitely recommend the rainbow case to have a chance to try out the full variety rather than just picking a single flavor to start though.<br /><br />They're probably a very healthy (relatively speaking) alternative to traditional soft drinks, so if you're someone who drinks a LOT of soda, these probably would be worth trying out. The lack of coloring agents is a big plus, and they're low-glycemic-impact. The &#34;GMO free&#34; thing I think is worthless however, just because &#34;GMO&#34; doesn't really tell you anything useful either way.<br /><br />So this review is not going to change the average rating, but 4 out of 5 stars seems like the right score.<br /><br />Recommended to try out, and good for what they are, but as a soft-drink alternative I'm not sure I really need once of these over a nice cold glass of water.<br /><br />G.",4

I typically stick to tea and water but I am always nauseous (not sure why) like a pregnant woman even though I'm not pregnant so I drink carbonated beverages like Zevia to calm my stomach.

First, let me state that I gave up soda several years ago, after being a diehard diet coke drinker, so these were a treat for me. I am glad I ordered this sampler pack. Some flavors were awesome, some were undrinkable. First, the good, my favorites were the black cherry and cream soda. These tasted exactly like their sugared counterparts. No aftertaste whatsoever. Next were the ones that were very good, grapefruit, grape, Dr Zevia (a little syrupy tasting) and ginger root beer (although, I like my root beer without ginger). Next were ones that weren't bad but just not full flavored, orange and Mountain Zevia. Lastly, were flavors I dumped after one sip, cola, lemon lime twist, and ginger ale.

At almost .95 cents a can, I try to limit myself to only one a day. I truly love this soda. I had experienced horrible headaches with other no calorie sodas due to the aspartame.

I haven't had it in years and I've missed it.  I was excited to hear about Zevia, as a natural sugar-free way to enjoy the sweet pop I love.  I've tried most if the flavors now, but we don't sell the Strawberry flavor in my area, so I headed to Amazon.<br /><br />The package arrived today, and it was heavy, but the cans were secure and none of them were damaged, which I was especially worried about because the plastic rings holding the 6 packs of Zevia together seem to be flimsy.  The pop itself is yummy.  Not so good warm, but good cold, and though the other reviews said they didn't taste the Strawberry, I think it tastes more like Strawberry than regular red pop.  It's not perfect, and it does leave a sweet aftertaste like all Stevie products seem to do, but it satisfies my sweet craving without calories, so it was worth the buy for me.",4

B00ZK6KUUY,"on November 1, 2015",A1SINHLUYMCCRK,Is quinine in tonic water safe?,Overall I would prefer to get my tonic water without pre addeed sweetener to make it more flexible as not all mixed drinks/concoctions require added sweetener. Overall the natural health  claims seem somewhat irrelevant since  the alcohol itself is the real health risk in any mixed drink. In addition it is fun  to note that quinine is actually a medicine that was historically used for restless legs and to treat malaria. It is now considered to have an unacceptable risk of side effects when used at medicinal doses.  It was apparently the daily use of quinine to treat malaria that led to the invention of the  gin and tonic. In the USA  the amount of quinine that is added to tonic is regulated by the FDA so that the maximum of  amount of quinine that could be legally present in 12 ounces of tonic water is less than 30 milligrams. This  is about one tenth of the medicinal dose for leg cramps.  So the small amount of quinine that would be present in a few ounces of tonic water is again much less a problem than the alcohol that is present in mixed drinks.  As a plus quinine does glow under black light.  Enjoy your gin and tonics in moderation and don't worry a lot about the quinine  unless you have had a prior problem with it.<br /><br />I will add a lnk as a comment.,3

B00ZK6KUUY,"on October 28, 2015",AKLAVKJBNRMBW,"Zero Sugar! Zero Carbs! Try them all and see, I did.","Let me start by saying that I havent had real soda in over 5 years due to the high sugar content, so my review could be thrown off by my cravings for some soda that tastes like my favorite flavors, vice 50g of sugar. Before quitting soda in its entirety, my favorite flavors were Dr. Pepper, Coca-Cola, and Sprite.<br /><br />I bought the variety pack in an effort to give the fullest review possible for Zevia products! Here are my findings, no flavor left out but starting with my favorites(note: all flavors are the new clear versions):<br /><br />Soda like flavors-<br /><br />Ginger Ale:  9/10, great mixer for my favorite cheaper whiskeys, Jameson, Bulliet, etc Its a great authentic ginger flavor, as Zevia actually used real ginger and citrus oils so its also good on the stomach like real ginger ale. Its definitely a flavor that I keep on hand for all occasions, get togethers or afternoon refreshment.<br /><br />Dr. Zevia: 10/10, pleasantly surprised! In the past Dr. Pepper was my everyday drinker so letting go of these sugary and carb loaded drinks were depressing to say the least. NOW, the time has come that I discovered my old friend but dressed a little differently in packaging. Absouletly great and similar in flavor to the real thing. Perfect score for me!<br /><br />Cola: 8/10, deliciously refreshing! Ive noticed a lot of negative feedback on the Cola flavor but I dont see the problem that others talk about. Bad aftertaste? Have you not realized the aftertaste of real Cola?? Its the same thing, all soda leaves an aftertaste so get used to this after taste or let your teeth rot and drink your daily intake of sugar in one sitting with Coca-Cola. Now, for me the flavor is spot on and I really enjoy the similar flavors brought out Zevia in the Cola flavor!<br /><br />Ginger Root Beer: 9/10, bubbly than ever but great flavor. This is actually the first Zevia flavor I tried and what turned me on to buying the entire variety pack and trying them all. Flavor is perfect in all aspects, reminds me of drinking A&W Root Beer. Now all flavors of Zevia are quite bubbly bit this flavor in particular felt like it needed to rest for a moment before drinking or else it felt like the liquid you sipped up turned into pure bubbles in your mouth! Aftertaste, again you just need to accept that all soda has an aftertaste so if its not the same as your normal root beer then continue to rot your brain.<br /><br />Cherry Cola: 9/10, big fan after stepping out of my comfort zone. I havent been a big fan of cherry cola, ever, but this flavor enabled me to have a change in heart towards cherry flavored refreshments. NOT overly sweet like the real deal, so this could be a turn off or a turn on. Give it a try and decide for yourself!<br /><br />Mountain Zevia: 9/10, big flavor and right flavor! I really enjoyed this one and believe it relates to Mountain Dew but I actually like it better than what I remember from the actual soda. Flavors of orange, lime, lemon and grapefruit run through my veins with this drink, but wait maybe thats the caffeine! This one has a nice boost in it for some reason. Maybe have this one like a pre-workout, or before you hit this slopes this winter season.<br /><br />Caffeine Free Cola: 8/10, didnt taste the difference between the Cola and this caffeine free flavor so thats a plus! Not much to say here except that its good for that late night craving without the caffeine involved.<br /><br />Cream Soda: 6/10, this one is personal. NOT a cream soda fan so I could barely stomach 3 sips to get the flavor. If you like cream soda then this might be for you!<br /><br />Lemon Lime Twist: 4/10, cleaning product? Very disappointing flavor, especially if this is the Sprite equivalent. I thought I was drinking something from underneath my kitchen sink. Sorry Zevia, better luck next time on this one.<br /><br />Fruity flavors-<br /><br />Grapefruit Citrus: 10/10, my favorite of the fruitys! I was actually pleasantly surprised by this flavor and would but it over and over again. It is a great mix of grapefruit and lemon lime flavors that meet perfectly in the middle. Not like a juice, not like a soda, but just right! Also, caffeine free!<br /><br />Black Cherry: 8/10: another flavor great flavor! Honestly wasnt expecting much of this one but it was delicious. A good berry soda without the old normal flavors involved. Again, not juice flavors but soda with strong hints of black cherry. Caffeine free!<br /><br />Orange: 8/10, if youre a orange soda fan then this flavor is great! Havent been an orange soda in the past due to such a thick flavor feeling hitting my taste buds this flavor has just the right amount of flavor and classic soda feeling. Again, caffeine free!<br /><br />Grape: ??/10, Wow couldnt drink this one to give it a review, but hey it smelled like grape juice! Not a fan, try someone else to get this review.<br /><br />Strawberry: 7/10, strawberry just isnt a flavor that goes with bubbly soda to me but I could see this being a great mixer with your liquor of choice! OR if you have kids, this could be a great non-sticky fruit drink. Caffeine free!!<br /><br />These are just my opinions and tastebuds so before you let peoples negatives reviews get the best of your add to cart click, just think of how many people come on just to complain because they have been drinking real soda all of their life. These drinks are by far the closest thing to real soda without the terrible health side effects. I dont know about you, but these will stay stocked in my fridge!!<br /><br />Note: I still drink these daily so I will check back in to update my review if I have a change in heart.",5

I had tried them a while back and really enjoyed them, but due to budget I couldn't keep getting them. I was recently told by my doctor that I have to stay away from wheat, oats, and corn. Wheat and oats aren't that hard to stay away from, but corn on the other hand is in so many things including caramel color. When I was in the grocery store the other day I remembered Zevia is sweetened with Stevia and thought that maybe I could get their Lemon Lime Twist flavor as it probably wouldn't have any caramel color. Well, when I got the the section I almost started crying when I saw that their labels say &#34;No Caramel Color'!! I was beyond thrilled! I can now have all of their sodas because they're all clear!! I love Cream Soda and thought I'd never be able to drink one ever again, but now I can!<br /><br />These sodas taste a bit different than the big brands, but then again, don't all &#34;off-brand&#34; sodas taste different from each other?

And it is non-GMO.<br /><br />I really like the taste of stevia, and the monk fruit, which are the sweeteners in this mixer.  I don't drink, but I have had this type of drink before - plain - and I think it is refreshing.  My husband mixed it with bourbon and he likes it.<br /><br />I am all for non-GMO, sweetened with stevia products.  Stevia is the only sweetener not proven to be bad for you - as it is a plant.  Many people have used it for many years with no ill effect.  This is vegan, kosher, and gluten-free as well.  So we are off to a good start.<br /><br />The only ingredient that I questioned was the erythritol.  It is near the top of the list of ingredients.  What I found was that it is a sugar substitute, and is questionable as far as side-effects are concerned.  It is odd that Zevia doesn't mention that with the other sweeteners, even if it really has little or no calories.<br /><br />I'm not concerned, as I consume Mio, a drink mix made with sugar substitute, but if that sugar substitute means anything to you please take note.<br /><br />I've found that: &#34;Erythritol is a sugar alcohol that has been approved for use as a food additive in the United States and throughout much of the world. It was discovered in 1848 by British chemist John Stenhouse. Wikipedia&#34; Anything ending in &#34;ol&#34; is suspect, but it may be pure speculation.  My take on it is that it isn't the ingredient that bothers me; just that it wasn't mentioned in the blurb on the cans with the other sweeteners.<br /><br />It is quite delicious and refreshing.  I feel that many of us breath smog every day, and don't necessarily get COPD.  There are many pollutants and so-called poisons we allow ourselves to consume -- even the most careful and thoughtful of us.  This ingredient may mean nothing to you.  For me, I used to drink a lot of soda, and now that I have osteoporosis I have only an occasional glass of soda.<br /><br />Recommended for all - unless you have a problem with it.",4

I do put Stevia in my coffee on a daily basis and so I was expecting this drink to be slightly sweet. The taste winds up being something akin to a regular Coke in terms of sweetness. It was too sweet for my taste.<br /><br />The second problem is that this drink contains a sugar alcohol called erythritol, which is &#34;created when a type of yeast ferments glucose&#34;. This seemed quite apparent to me as this drink has a very weird and lingering aftertaste, something that I think could be linked to the yeast. Erythritol is &#34;better&#34; because it does not get broken down in the body and does not affect blood sugar according to the article I read about it.<br /><br />Overall, I was disappointed with this product.

And, of course I'm aware of the effects of that much soda/chemicals on my body.  I know what you're thinking - why not just drink 1 soda and call it good?  Sounds reasonable, but, I know myself I know one can would never be enough (at least to start).  After trying another brand of Stevia soda (tasted like dirt) I was hesitant to try Zevia.  To my surprise, I really enjoy it.  No, it's not the same as my old diet brand.  But, that's okay. Yes, it is considerably more expensive, but that has allowed me to wean myself down to 2 cans per day because I can't afford it otherwise. I really like the fact that it uses stevia, comes in so many flavors, and also is clear (no added colors).  I realize it's not a health food, but it has helped me kicked a nasty habit that has held me hostage while traveling.  I had my last can of regular diet soda on July 14 - and I haven't looked back.

B00ZK6KUUY,"on September 30, 2015",A57Q87B0TC9IJ,Strong ginger flavor with an aftertaste that may not be palatable to the average soda drinker,"Stevia is a plant related to the ragweed and daisy whose leaves have been used for centuries as a sweetener in South America.  It has no calories and is 200 times sweeter than sugar pound-for-pound.  Because of this, Stevia has been making inroads into the sugar substitute market, especially for those looking for all-natural alternative to traditional sugar.  One example is this ginger-ale soda, aptly named Ztevia just in case you were wondering what was in it.<br /><br />The ingredient label reads as follows:<br />Carbonated water, Erythritol, Citric Acid, Reb A (Stevia Extract), Natural Flavors, Monk Fruit Extract<br /><br />I was curious about Erythritol so I looked it up.  It's a sugar alcohol like Sorbitol and Xylitol that may cause the associated digestive ills such as diarrhea, headache and upset stomach with excessive consumption.  It's nearly calorie free and about 70% the sweetness of actual sugar.  As for Monk Fruit, it's yet another sweetener.  It's fruit is native to Thailand and China and the extract is up to 300 times sweeter than sugar.<br /><br />The taste:<br />The first taste is a sharp bite of ginger that's stronger than your average Schweppes or Canada Dry ginger ale.  Afterwards it's the same cool carbonated water you would taste in a regular soda.  It's the aftertaste that most will have trouble with.  It's a sweet and woody taste that lingers. It somewhat resembles the taste of asparagus and it lasts for a while after you've already swallowed your drink.<br /><br />I have switched to diet drinks a long time ago so please look at my review from that standpoint.  It's not bad and I certainly wouldn't turn one down if it was offered to me.  At the same time, I don't think this will be liked by sugar soda drinkers.  Diet soda drinkers will take to this if anyone but it will take some getting used to.  I'll mark the review as three stars -- it's okay, but not something I'll likely switch to.",3

Of course, you could accuse me of liking every ginger ale I've ever tasted and probably win.<br /><br />This Zevia ginger ale is very light, in fact, I would think of it more as &#34;ginger infused water&#34;.  Its not strong at all, its very light.  The flavoring from the monk fruit and the Stevia extract is a little different in flavor, I think I still prefer cane sugar.  I know sugar is evil and all, but, a light amount of cane sugar might not have been all bad.<br /><br />There seems to be a bit of film left on the tongue and a  slight aftertaste, I don't know if thats common for all Stevia drinks... so I remove a star for that.",4
B00ZK6KUUY,"on September 28, 2015",A2JNI9V0X3YHK,A good effort at a healthier sugar-free carbonated soda with no unpleasant aftertaste.,"This is a good tasting zero calorie carbonated drink, though not as strongly flavored as my personal favorite Vernors (back in the old days when its flavor was aged for 4 years in wood casks.) From the name, I expected Zevia to be sweetened with Stevia, but it's a bit more complex than that. Rather than forms of Stevia I've bought before, this soda contains Reb A (Rebaudioside A, a sweeter Stevia extract), combined with Erithritol (a sugar alcohol), and Monk Fruit extract (another sweetener.) The goal was apparently a healthier sugar-free drink without the characteristic aftertaste associated with Stevia.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Ginger is not listed as an ingredient of this &#34;Ginger Ale&#34;, unless it is among what are listed as &#34;Natural Flavors&#34;. It is not listed as Organic, but is listed as GMO-free, with no caramel color. I'd recommend going the whole Vernor's route, with real ginger flavor aged for years in wood casks.<br /><br />The result appears to meet its goal of a refreshing drink without any unpleasant aftertaste, though I was a bit underwhelmed to have to Google so many of its ingredients to know what I was really drinking. There is also still an open question as to the long-term effect on weight of drinking anything your gut bacteria THINK is sugared, even though it is calorie-free.<br /><br />Normally, when I want a carbonated drink, I drink unflavored tap water, carbonated with a Sodastream. I then occasionally add a bit of organic Pomegranite juice for flavor, a combination I can be even more sure contains nothing bad for me, at an unbeatable cost, with no need to lug anything heavy home from the store.<br /><br />Zevia is a good alternative for away from home.",4

I didn't taste any of the bitterness I exected so this will be on the top of my shopping list from now on.  It contains Erythroitol which is a sugar alcohol but does not have the same negative affect on the body that other sugar alcohols cause (gas, bloating, diarrhea).  We opened the first can and enjoyed it in a cocktail and later I heard the sound of a second can being opened.  Today, no negative side effects.<br /><br />I can't wait to try other flavors.

I also wonder if it has MSG--I get suspicious whenever I see &#34;natural flavor&#34; on an ingredients label.

Not fantastic, but pretty nice cold.","I've never had Zevia before so didn't know what to expect from their ginger ale (coincidentally, I had regular ginger ale about a month ago for the first time in years. I remembered liking it before but this time, I was disappointed that I didn't. Too sweet. Too chemical-tasting.<br /><br />So how would Zevia compare with that, since ginger ale is not even a favorite drink for me?<br /><br />The answer is... not bad.  It has a &quot;sharper fizz&quot; than the cokes or pepsis I normally would drink (though not a big soda drinker--probably a glass or two a week). It is also less sweet than my regular sodas--this is a very good thing, since the average coke has 12 tsp of sugar in one can.  Each can of Zevia has zero sugar and zero calories (the reason I bumped it up to 4 stars).  There is also no coloring and I like that, too, a nice, naturally sweetened clear soda.<br /><br />At first, however, I didn't like the flavor. It's kind of sweet, not like saccharine but not exactly like sugar either. It is simultaneously &quot;significantly less sweet&quot; than soda and still &quot;a little too sweet&quot; and has an aftertaste that isn't exactly unpleasant but takes some getting used to. The ginger-and-citrus-oil flavor is mild, not very ginger-y. Didn't hate it; didn't love it either.  I tried mixing it with fruit juice and liked it better, making an interesting, tarter fruit soda.<br /><br />After trying it over a few days, I started not thinking of it as &quot;ginger ale&quot; and just thinking of it as a somewhat sweet, somewhat bitter soda. With ice, it was refreshing--no calories, no sugar--and when I stopped expecting &quot;ginger ale&quot;, I liked the slightly bitter flavor.  I tried using it as a mixer--tried fruit juices, milk, wine, a twist of lime, even tequila, but finally decided I liked it best straight or mixed with soda water and a squeeze of lime (always lots of ice, too). In the end, I bumped it from 3 to 4 stars and actually find it a very acceptable substitute for soda--definitely enjoy the benefits of being a naturally sugar free and no calorie drink.  I grew to like this for its slight bitterness, but will also try some of the other flavors, too. I like that they sell them in &quot;rainbow&quot; multipacks, too, so you can sample a can without committing to finishing six (or 24) cans of the same drink.&nbsp;<a class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zevia-Naturally-Sweetened-Drinks-Rainbow-Pack-24-Count-Pack-of-24/dp/B00ZK6KUUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zevia Naturally Sweetened Drinks, Rainbow Pack, 24 Count (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />Good product in the end, but it took a little getting used to.",4

The advantages of a tonic water with no calories, and a safer non-caloric sweetener outweighed the cons of the product. It begins to taste better after one gets used to it, and doesn't drink it alongside regular tonic water.<br /><br />------------------------------------<br /><br />I tried this with gin, ice, and a squirt of lime, I am used to Stevia and found that the taste was fine, not great. Mr. Hasselaar, an expert taster and discerning gourmand when it comes to mixed drinks, stated that this tonic water was just barely &#34;OK&#34;. He compared it to another brand of tonic water, sweetened with one of the many artificial sweeteners, and he felt that Zevia had less of an aftertaste, and none of the bitterness associated with the other diet brand.<br /><br />This Zevia brand diet tonic water is not as refreshing as full calorie tonic water. The Stevia leaves a rather long-lived aftertaste in the mouth, and not such a pleasant one at that. However, Mr. Hasselaar agreed that if forced to drink a diet tonic water, this would be his choice out of a bad bunch. I find the taste less objectionable and being used to Stevia, am not quite as bothered by the noticeable and lingering  Stevia taste.<br /><br />So, it is a mixed bag - I would buy it and use it, Mr. H. would not. I do frequently drink diet tonic water and will probably buy some Zevia, purely to save calories. The taste of the Stevia is a bit less pronounced with a rum and tonic plus a squirt of lime, my drink - so I am happy.",3

This mixer uses erythritol (a largely indigestible ""sugar alcohol""), stevia (a plant extract), and monk fruit extract for its sweetness.

Starting less sweet lets you adjust the sweetness to taste via simple syrup, juice, or your preferred flavor addition (you can always add more sweetness to your drink, but can't unsweeten it).<br /><br />If you're looking to cut back on your drinking calories, the mixers are the place to do it, and this Zevia serves the purpose well.

It could be that there is not enough quinine to give it that distinct bitter flavor that consumers of tonic water look for.

No go for this household.,"We rarely have a soft drink in the house but from time to time, enjoy a little something different and thought this low/no calorie, non GMO healthy alternative could be a nice alternative. Normally I'm not a big fan of things in cans but for a sporadic drink, figured it would be okay. Initially I thought the sweetness came exclusively from stevia - a herb - and monk fruit. Well, on closer inspection this also has Erythritol which is a type of fermented non sugar sweetener tooted as the next best thing since sliced bread. It doesn't add calories, it doesn't spike blood sugar (so is a good alternative for diabetics/elderly) and it doesn't promote tooth decay...wow, sounds great. Being my normal cynical self, it also sounded too good to be true so I did some more digging around and found that indeed, all of that is true...but Erythritol also has a dirty little secret...it's a friggin insecticide. Yes, it's considered a 'safe' insecticide but it is an insecticide just the same. Don't take my word for it, do a web search for yourself. As for me and my household, we will pass on knowingly putting any type of insecticide into our body. Why doesn't the company just stick to stevia...a decent little safe herb instead of expecting consumers to ingest an insecticide?",2

I wasn't sure I'd like this when I ordered it. I do love ginger ale - technically, I love ginger beer and I think of ginger ale as a poor, bland substitute. Ginger ale is sweet where ginger beer has a bite. And if it's got stevia instead of sugar ... what is it going to taste like?<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the first can in my 6-pack. It's got a crisp taste, really no aftertaste to speak of (which is a surprise with a non-sugar sweetener), and it goes down pleasantly enough. The flavor really isn't ginger - I'm not sure there's any in the soda itself although the ingredient list includes monkfruit - but it's really good on its own. It's mellow, not too sweet, and it doesn't linger so it does taste clean.<br /><br />Should I comment on the carbonation? I think it was a fine amount, thank you.

I hope the trend of more choices continues with drinks like this one.  This is pretty great in mixed alcohol drinks such as with gin.

This actually tasted like a lot like  a black cherry. 5/5 stars<br /><br />Ginger ale - This one was always one of my favorite ones before the caramel coloring removal. Since the removal of the coloring, this is probably the one flavor that still tastes mostly the same. It was difficult to get used to other flavors without the coloring because I could taste a difference but the ginger ale. I couldn't taste any difference. And it's also great for an upset stomach (unlike the seagram's brand which added sucralose to their non-diet). 5/5 stars<br /><br />Tonic Water - This one was just ok. Flavor Wise - it's on point. good when mixed with Gin or Vodka. but that bitter after taste Stevia is known to have, There's just a little too much of it, making the drink unpleasant. if the stevia aftertaste wasn't so present in this, I might like it more. 2.5/5 stars.

As compared with other zero calorie soda with artificial sweeteners, yes this is better.  I don't drink soda on a regular basis and neither does my family so we will probably stick to the regular sodas for the occasional treat.

B00ZK6KUUY,"on September 12, 2015",A1SMO511H9HDXL,Still The Best For Me,I started drinking Zevia before they changed to GMO certified.  It seems like it tasted slightly better then but that could be all in my mind.  I continue to drink this cola because it is still the best choice when combining taste and medical hazards.<br /><br />1) No phosphoric acid - Most colas contain Phosphoric Acid.  Zevia contains Citric Acid.  Over the short haul Phosphoric acid is clearly much worse.  Dentists even use Phosphoric Acid to eat the enamel off of teeth when bonding a crown or cap to a tooth.  But Citric Acid is worst if left on the teeth for an extended time period.  So it is best to chew some gum or drink some water after drinking either type of drink..<br /><br />2) Zero calories - All of the zero calorie colas have some type of after taste because of the sugar substitutes.  I have grown accustomed to this one.  For me it is no worse or better than the others taste-wise.<br /><br />3) No Artificial Sweeteners - People continue to argue over whether certain ones cause cancer or whatever.  This one has stevia extract which is all natural.  I don't have to waste much time worrying about the news on those other ones.<br /><br />4) No Caramel Coloring - Although there are lots of arguments about the evils of this ingredient the main side effect is that it causes a yellowing of the teeth which is more about appearance than medical issues.<br /><br />EDIT* - Changed information about Phosphoric Acid,5

Check that out too if you like Dr Pepper.",5
B00ZK6KUUY,"on September 11, 2015",A11L5M4MJP00UW,GREAT SUBSTITUTE FOR REGULAR OR DIET SODAS - NOT BAD TASTING,"I am very enthusiastic about this soda because it is the only soda that I know of that is sweetened totally with stevia, which I think is considered one of the safest artificial sweeteners there is. (Update: It is also sweetened with erythritol, but it is considered a relatively safe sweetener too; also Monk Fruit provides some sweetening.)  If you are diabetic, this is probably one of the safest sodas you can drink, if you feel you have to have soda.  The usual diet soda is supposedly worse than regular soda for diabetics (or anyone); the artificial sweeteners like aspartame are just not good for us.  That's why this is such an exciting product, due to the safety of stevia.  They have 15 flavors, but this is probably one of the better flavors that I have tried.  How is the taste really?  Well, it's not going to taste the same as a regular sugared soda or even a diet soda.  It is different and takes a little getting used to.  Let's just say it is a good substitute, but not a replacement.  I was a little disappointed when I contacted the company they did not respond to an inquiry.  I was asking about caffeine-free versions of their drinks.  Some of them have caffeine, but this particular flavor does not, which is great.  I did find on the website that they also do put out a caffeine-free cola, but I have not yet seen that in the stores.  They also have cola with caffeine.  Sometimes I want caffeine and sometimes I don't.  Now I can get with or without, at least on some flavors.  I can't have caffeine at night or it keeps me awake.  I would like to see a little better pricing on their products, but I'm sure it is hard to complete with the big soda companies.  Also would like to see the product in more stores; sometimes I have a hard time finding it.  If you need to give up regular soda and don't like diet or don't feel that it is good for you, give Zevia a try.  Try a few flavors before you decide, as some flavors are better than others.  If I could get this at a better price, it would be the only soda I would buy.",5

Yes, I realize that soda isn't a healthy choice, but when I want to drink soda, which isn't that often (once a week?), I want the full dose. This soda has a flavored-water tepidness and the lack of sugar is as obvious as it is in all other diet sodas.<br /><br />It wasn't awful but it wasn't a product that makes me wish to buy it again.

I'm very sensitive to artificial sweeteners and almost anything that's not all natural. My stomach got extremely upset from the first and second experience with trying the new formula. It's not just disappointing because of the very skeptical and now bitter taste but also because the product didn't turn out for the better after removing the caramel coloring that isn't good for us. I've been such a loyal customer for quite some time now and only drank Zevia as a treat because it actually hit the spot for me when I craved something sweet. Unfortunately, I will now have to stop drinking the sodas, which may be a good thing overall.

As to whether this soda is somehow more or less healthy I'll leave to the experts.  It contains the sweetener Erythritol along with Stevia, another sweetener.  If you have concerns about non-sugar sweeteners you should read up on these and decide just how natural these are or how they may affect your digestive track.  I'm not a fan of soda though I may drink one or two diet sodas a month.

These are delicious, but lighter and a bit tangy-er on the palate. Just sip them and enjoy what Zevia has to offer. Clear your mind of any preconceptions. They stand very well on their own.

Recalling that I'd liked that flavor, I decided to give the rainbow case a go. A couple of the flavors are bearable, such as the orange, lemon-lime, and root beer flavors. The others, unfortunately, were just not good. Stevia has a noticeable bitter flavor on the back of the tongue, and its tough to get past, even if you power through and continue drinking it as others have suggested.

I couldn't have been happier.<br /><br />I have been able to successful shed almost 25lbs in the last few months and a huge part of that is having something that fills me up and conquers my sweet tooth. I drink one everyday with lunch. I have told so many people about it.  Even bought some for my mom to try.  She texted me days later and said she had the munchies but because of the black cherry zevia she was able to not blow her diet but still have something sweet.<br /><br />I do NOT taste a differences in the colored vs colorless sodas.  It is sad how much marketing makes us assume that colors = flavor.  It does't have to be colorful to be good.  I for one am happy that we are actually drinking a real drink without added ingredients that is just there to make it look good.  I am also thrilled about it being GMO free verified.  One of my concerns was the Erythritol since that is something that can come from corn.

Not at Amazon, however.  At a grocery store.  No flavor.  Only the fizzy.  Wondering if it might be old, I attempted to phone Zevia at the number on the can.  Automated answer directed me to select the person, or O for assistance.  Dialed the O, directed to leave message.  Terminated the call.  Went to their web site.  &#34;Contact Zevia&#34; button did nothing.  Dead, as in no link.  I have no interest in the various Twitter etc methods.

B00ZK6KUUY,"on August 5, 2015",A2OADM2SJZKY0K,"Zero calories, 100% flavor? Living the dream","Update: I've now had every flavor except Dr. Zevia and I stand by my review. Yes, they are more subtle, but I still like the flavors. They just don't set your teeth on edge like super sweet sodas. It was so nice getting to enjoy the delicious flavor of cream soda again without the guilt and calories.<br /><br />I'd given up sodas entirely out of respect for my internal organs, and stuck to water or juice. I'd opted for izze as an alternative. But, I got bored and wanted to try something else. All the other alt-soda products were scary with lab sugar and what not. Then I stumbled upon Zevia. I absolutely love these! I've only had four of the 12 flavors so far, but I really like them. I was scared how they would taste based on the bad reviews, but i have no idea what they're talking about. These are so yummy. No aftertaste. Just clean, flavorful, and refreshing. I've only had a mountain dew maybe twice in life, so not an expert, but i could tell that their version was a little more subtle than &#34;real&#34; mountain dew, but not bad by any means. Other than that I've been pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Observations, not complaints: They seem a little more fizzy than typical sodas so you have to wait for it to calm down or pour slowly. They also taste sweeter than i expected, but that might be because I'm not used to super sweet sodas anymore.<br /><br />I'll update as I go through other flavors.",5

I can drink Zevia without any guilt about what I'm putting in my body, especially now that they have even eliminated the carmel coloring. As far as this fruity pack is concerned, I LOVE the strawberry and grape flavors and orange is pretty good too. I think the black cherry flavor is pretty gross, so that's why I didn't give it five stars.",4

B00ZK6KUUY,"on July 27, 2015",A29CH6HIMUJYHY,Not all that good!,I was really excited when I found this company.  I have used Stevia and made my own sodas for a few years but it is a pain to have to make them from scratch.  All of these drinks could be more carbonated in my opinion.  But the real complaint  is the taste.  All the drinks have a syrupy aftertaste and leave a taste in your mouth like aspartame.  I know this is a matter of personal taste but I can't imagine how anyone likes these. My kids tried them and their opinion was the same.  I guess I'll go back to making my own flavored sodas.....or perhaps I'll start a company to compete  with them.  I don't think it would be hard to make a better natural fresh tasting soda.,3

I liked the old formula, and I like the new formula, but I couldn't detect the 'crispness' difference I noticed in the root beer and cola. I know the old version of this flavor was already not artificially colored so I'm wondering if it was already not artificially flavored, too. I suspect this formula didn't actually change at all except for the new &#34;Non-GMO Verified&#34; label on the can. I still very much like it, so it still easily earns 5 stars, but there is no noticeable change in taste. Honestly, that's probably a good thing to most people. For me, though, I enjoyed the improved taste of the Ginger Root Beer and Caffeine Free Cola so much, I was expecting the same here. Oh, well. Still great!",5

This new, non-GMO formula Ginger Root Beer, though, is outstanding. It has a new crispness to it and the flavor is surprisingly satisfying. It reminds me of Barq's root beer, which used to be a favorite of mine due to its crisp taste versus other brands. This is really good, and it has no artificial flavors, artificial sweeteners, artificial colors, calories, or caffeine. Also, my wife, who didn't used to be a fan of stevia in general, couldn't taste the stevia in this new formula. She really liked this flavor as well. For me, the caffeine-free cola is still my favorite flavor but, now,  this is a VERY close second. By far, this is the most improved flavor of the new Non-GMO formulas.",5
B00ZK6KUUY,"on July 24, 2015",A386XPC82R95YK,Better than the original!,"I've posted only a handful of Amazon reviews and usually only comment on things I either love or seriously dislike. However, I've been a Zevia drinker for quite some time and I was excited and nervous to try the new Non-GMO formulas. This was my favorite of the old formulas, so I was probably most nervous about this one, but I LOVE it. It's got the same cola taste, but the new formula has a slight crispness to it that I didn't detect in the old formula. The difference is very slight, though. I can also detect what I think is a hint of fruit, maybe, but I'm not sure if I would've even noticed that if I hadn't read one of the other reviews before trying it. Either way, I'm very relieved and thrilled to report that this formula is even better than before and I appreciate the fact that there are no artificial colors, sweeteners, or flavors. Also, my wife, who doesn't traditionally like something about the taste of stevia, said there is far less stevia taste in this formula versus the old one. She liked the new version much better, too.<br /><br />I should also mention that I tried the new ginger root beer formula. I'll write a quick review over there for that, but I wanted to mention it here in case anyone else felt the same way I did. I was not a fan, at all, of the old Zevia root beer, but I was very pleasantly surprised by the new formula. The ginger root beer also has the new crispness and the flavor is very tasty. It reminded me a lot of Barq's Root Beer, only without the caffeine. I was very impressed and my wife really liked it, as well. So, if you generally like root beer, but weren't a fan of the old Zevia root beer, I'd highly recommend giving the new formula ginger root bear a try, too!",5

Zevia, please go back to the kitchen and work on this....get it right because I know it can be better and would really enjoy a good Tonic.

First the flavor was very subtle which isn't bad in its own right.  In fact the Cream soda actually tastes good... until the after taste kicks in.  How would I describe the flavor; it's not a bitter taste but a heavy, thick, off flavor like if you were to let some sugar or a piece of bread sit in your mouth for awhile.  The other problem with the after taste is once it kicks in it will stay with you for a while.<br /><br />So all in all I would not recommend this drink based on the after taste alone.",2

B010O757HY,"on June 29, 2016",A35Q0RBM3YNQNF,Seagram's Ginger Ale -- Weak Ginger Taste and Contains Artificial Sweetener,"Wow, this purchase was disappointing on every level. The ginger flavor is weak with no zing, and seems almost watered down. Additionally, the inclusion of sucralose (Splenda) in a non-diet labeled soda is an unwelcome discovery. And, rightly or wrongly, I feel a lingering annoyance at the lack of forthrightness.<br /><br />Stating 25% less calories on the box does not automatically indicate the use of an artificial sweetener. Seagrams shares the name with a line of liquor so I hoped the soda would simply be a little less syrupy sweet, with a flavor perhaps a bit more grown-up -- but not diet.<br /><br />Usually the packaging boldly states Diet or Ten or some other indication of an artificially sweetened product. It is common for people to have sensitivities to sucralose or simply wish to avoid it so what is the reasoning for mentioning its inclusion only in the ingredient listing?<br /><br />Reading the ingredient label searching for diet ingredients in non-diet soda is not normally a part of a soft drink purchase but I guess Ill be checking from now on. So, between the diluted taste and the buried Splenda, Ill stick with Canada Dry or TJs in the future. Both of the other brands have a much more pronounced ginger bite to their flavor.",1

They sat me down, gave me a cup of Seagram's ginger ale and my symptoms abated immediately, like magic. I couldn't believe it. And I remained well for the rest of the flight. (Came down with the horrific head cold next morning after safely home, but that's a separate matter.) Reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it is a commercial brand and of course does contain the unhealthy sugars. But for settling the stomach, the real ginger helped so very much!

Yes, it could've been a fluke, but I'll stick to my plain high sugar soda, but I'll just drink it once a week or less. I don't drink it that often now as it is.",2

You may need a taste adjustment period is you are married to one flavor.,"If you still can't tolerate drinking a diet soda here and there, then this won't fix things for you. I live on diet soda alone most of the time, much to the chagrin of my husband. However, with that said I get tired of his nagging about aspartame and truthfully I do need to cut down on it. As I'm a narcoleptic, soda is my preferred source of caffeine and I don't want fully sugared so Viola! It is very tasty and when I'm in a hurry it pretty much tastes like the half and half I would cocktail myself at the soda fountain. The blend is definitely better than the last Blue Sky Soda I had that was similar in nature. Yet, if you drink one type of soda alone and are married to it and you never bounce around, this will take a taste adjustment. For me there was no adjustment at all, but back in the day I used to be married solely to fully leaded Dr Pepper, so I do understand your plight. My now much looser lips are ready to find this stuff everywhere and at the same price as it's siblings. Because $3 for a 6-pack is a bit ridiculous to pay regularly. I'm still paying it sporadically though because, yes it is tasty. The can also seems to deflect husband nagging.

Honestly, I am not sure where this product falls in the brand's lineup.<br /><br />It is not sugary-sweet.  I think of Pepsi as a more sweet drink, then the original Coke.

If I had seen this and known that they weren't selling a &#34;better Coca-Cola&#34; then I wouldn't have bought it in the first place, since my expectation was for more of a Coca-Cola taste.

Your reaction to it might be hit or miss. My wife and I enjoy regular (sugar) Pepsi; but the aftertaste with 1893 turned her off to it completely whereas I love it.

However I do really like ginger ale so this product intrigued me. First you may with to note that all of the ingredients on the label are simple, easy to pronounce names. Second the cans are not the same size as standard cans they are taller (I'll attach a photo to show that as well). Each can does have 12 ounce, I know because I poured mine into a 12 oz beverage glass to check.<br /><br />The flavor is still cola but there is a very strong ginger flavor that makes it acceptable to me. I actually enjoyed drinking one of these! Each can has 150 calories however so it is not the sort of treat to have regularly unless you regularly drink soda pop. My entire family really enjoyed these, too, the one who loves colas and the one who is just meh about colas. The ginger really made a difference.<br /><br />Warning: The box says it contains 12 cans but the one I was sent to review only had 10 cans; I'll include a photo to show you. Since the box was inside another box and this box was damaged when I received it, it suggests that the missing cans had to have gone missing from within Amazon itself. Did someone take them?

It's about time!<br /><br />The cola itself gets 5 stars, obviously, but I just have to state my opinion about a couple of things.<br /><br />1. I couldn't find it in my local grocery store, or even at the &#34;big box&#34; store!? I only found it at the local convenience store. I had probably passed right by it before, not even realizing what it was. Because of the placement, and also because of the shape of the can, I'm guessing that an awful lot of people just pass right by it thinking it's just another stupid energy drink in a tall black can.<br /><br />In my opinion, this soda needs to be on store shelves right next to the Pepsi and Dr. Pepper. It ought to be in the same 12-packs of cans that those sodas come in. Now, I understand if the price is just a little higher because of the real sugar and natural kola nut extract, and all of that stuff. OK, so maybe it's 5 or 6 dollars per 12-pack, rather than the 3 dollars we're used to with Coke and Pepsi. I'm OK with that, but you have to put it in packaging that people will associate with &#34;cola&#34;, rather than just hiding it away in convenience stores in &#34;energy drink&#34; style cans. Most people will not even bother seeking it out to try it if they don't even know what it's supposed to be.<br /><br />It's COLA, so put it where other colas are sold.<br /><br />2. This is more of a personal thing. I'm trying to cut back on sugar, whether it be the &#34;high fructose corn syrup&#34; variety, or the real sugar like 1893 has. As much as I love this stuff, I don't drink it, or any other sugared soda very often for that reason. That's why I am really hoping that we will soon see a &#34;low sugar&#34; version of this soda. We now know that it is possible to create a lower sugar version of a soda that is virtually indistinguishable from the high sugar version, thanks to Dr. Pepper Ten. I sincerely hope that using some combination of sucralose, stevia, monk fruit, and real sugar, we will soon be able to enjoy this same flavor without so much sugar intake.<br /><br />And everything I said pretty much goes for the ginger version as well. That stuff is great too!<br /><br />So, in a nutshell, put this soda where it belongs, right there on the grocery store soda shelf, charge just a little more for it, because it is worth it, and get to working on that low-sugar version.",5

That said...<br /><br />What we have here is, at least supposedly, is the the way the drink was originally made when the company first came about (apparently called 'Brad's Drink'). Honestly I doubt it tasted the same. But that's irrelevant -- the result is very satisfying, possibly a combination of the kola nut extract along with using -- most importantly -- real sugar instead of that HFCS crap.<br />There's not much else to say. It still tastes like Pepsi but without that underlying overly sweet bit that makes we not like it so much. So it actually makes for a satisfying drink experience.<br />One thing to note -- cans are taller and thinner than normal soda cans, though it's still 12oz each.

I might try the original version but another concern is that this version barely arrived in the box.  The external Amazon box was in decent condition but the inner box was beaten up, ripped and the cans were about to spill loose.  One can was heavily dented.  Luckily none of them leaked.

For me it's not just about what is or isn't healthy, but rather a plethora of food sensitivities and intolerance.<br /><br />Food coloring is one thing I have issues with, HFCS is another. And since most sodas use corn syrup, I don't drink many. But Pepsi 1893 uses real sugar, ginger and kola nuts for its flavor, not high fructose corn syrup which is found in regular Pepsi, and you can tell the difference. Each of these flavors stand out rather than get lost or being overshadowed by another. I'm enjoying this ginger version of Pepsi 1893 so much that once I've finished this pack, I'm planning on buying a pack of the original flavor as well to try out.",5

Here, the presence of real sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup improves the overall product, and the taste is a little less sugary-syrup-sweet. That part is great. Now they've added Ginger (thus creating Ginger Cola). This adds a bit of heat to the drink. At first sip, it's cola. But as it goes down, there's the aftertaste of ginger along with the familiar warming mouthfeel. If you love ginger, you might just love this drink. I found that the addition of the ginger reduced the thirst quenching effect of the cola. I wanted to wash down the ginger, but each time I tried, there was more ginger! So ultimately, this is going to be very much up to your individual taste.<br /><br />Packaging differs from standard Pepsi in that this is a tall narrow golden can that looks somewhat like a beer/ale can rather than a soda can.

Exec Summary:  Amazingly good beverage, high recommend!","Before we begin, I mentioned to a couple of people that I was trying the new 1893 beverage from Pepsi. For the record, and because three out of three friends asked me the question, no, I dont think theres cocaine in itand I believe that story was about Coke, not Pepsi, as verified through Snopes. Even then, there was very little cocaine in the Coke (according to Snopes, in 1902, cocaine was as little as 1/400 of a grain of the drug (roughly fluid extract of Coco leaves) though it took until 1929 to become free of it. As far as I can tell, Pepsi never contained it.<br /><br />So, that aside, lets talk about the new 1893 soda, named for the first year that PepsiCo was founded.  First, its delicious.  Theres none of the cloying fructose taste.  The ingredients, from the can contain Kola nut extract, dark brown malt flavor, aromatic bitters, sparkling water and real sugar. Thats the baseline ingredients. From the can also: carbonated water, fair trade cane sugar, caramel color, phosphoric acid, sodium citrate, natural flavor (whatever that is,) potassium sorbate (preserving freshness,) caffeine (34 mg per 12 fl oz can,) gum arabic, Kola nut extract.  So two different ingredient lists on one cansorry if youre not sure why theres two; Im uncertain myself. Theres also 150 calories in a can, with 40 grams of carbs of which 39 grams are from sugar.<br /><br />You can taste the difference from regular pepsi (which I usually like) and this (which I think I love.)  Awesome taste.<br /><br />The can (see the picture) is tall, brown and would look vintage-y, except for the Pepsi logo painted on its side. There is also a Ginger Cola 1893 brand, its cans are a copper color.<br /><br />The can pours well, the soda pops satisfactorily and the taste is delicious.  It looks and smells like regular Pepsi but tastes much better.  The sweetness isnt cloying, a little earthier (possibly the bitters at work with Kola extract for nuttiness. It would probably go good as a strong drink mixer, the flavors are working overtime and would nicely offset rum, for example. My understanding is that PepsiCo is considering launching a restaurant brand, opening eateries in NYC.  This will likely be featured prominently in its beverages, both virgin and non-virgin.<br /><br />All in all, the beverage is everything I like about regular Pepsi, and it tastes quite a bit better!

It took a bit of getting used to, but I grew to like the stronger flavor.  I also appreciate that this is using real sugar, and other real ingredients.  Pepsi really seems to be leading the charge on this front, with products like this and also Throwback Pepsi.<br /><br />I also tried mixing this with Jack Daniels whiskey (Jack and Coke is the best drink ever!).

It doesn't taste at all like any Pepsi I've ever had, although I'm just 55, so I don't go back as far as this drink purportedly goes back.<br /><br />I don't like the tall, skinny cans. They're not retro. Aluminum cans for soft drinks only go back to the '60s, and even tin cans for soft drinks goes back to the '30s. In 1893, it would have been most likely to have it as a syrup, and added to carbonated water at serving time, but if it was going to be sold ready-to-drink, it would have been a bottle.<br /><br />So what's the point of the tall can? To make sure people know it's not an &#34;ordinary&#34; soft drink? To cement the idea that you don't buy this for everyday consumption?

If you don't like a strong ginger taste, you won't like this.  If (like me) you love ginger, this is a welcome new soda that's been a long time coming.<br /><br />I would describe this as mainly a strongly ginger flavored soda -- there is a cola taste too, but it is quite subtle.  You taste it more after you swallow it, after the initial burn of the ginger has subsided.  It's not just like they mixed half Pepsi and half ginger ale (if anything it's more like 90% ginger and 10% Pepsi, but the ginger is far stronger than any ginger ale I've had before).<br /><br />The ingredients are: water, sugar, caramel color, natural flavor, phosphoric acid, sodium citrate, caffeine, potassium sorbate, modified food starch, kola nut extract, ginger oleoresin.<br /><br />38 mg of caffeine is in one 12 oz can.<br /><br />Calories: 150<br />Total carbohydrates: 40 g<br />Sugars: 39 g<br /><br />Oh, I looked up one ingredient -- &quot;ginger oleoresin&quot; is apparently a natural sort of extract of ginger, they use CO2 to get as much ginger flavor in liquid form as possible out of the ginger root.  It's quite clear from drinking this that there virtually HAD to be real ginger in it, because you just don't get that specific taste and burn from anything else.  I sometimes take a chunk of ginger root and squeeze out the juice from it (using a garlic press) into water or tea to get a &quot;shot&quot; of real ginger to settle my stomach...this tastes exactly like that ginger.<br /><br />This tastes better with every can...it's not something you'd want to chug down on a hot day, but it's perfect for enjoying after dinner, possibly in a mixed drink.  Great to have on hand for a party (but not for kids).",5
B01D4B21KS,"on June 8, 2016",AK48G4QVPH3Y7,Refreshingly Different and High-Quality,"Pepsi's 1893 Ginger Cola offering is a refreshing take on bringing a new product line to the public.  Both the Ginger Cola and Cola have a taste that can be considered as being distinctly different than the Pepsi flagship brand.  In order to fully appreciate the flavor profile of the Ginger Cola, it helps to have tried the original 1893 Cola, as well.<br /><br />The original 1893 Cola is described as containing kola nut extract, a malty flavor, aromatic bitters, pure sugar, and carbonated water.  As to what it actually tastes like, the closest comparison that could be drawn is that it tastes like a more deeply flavored Royal Crown (RC) Cola.  RC definitely has the soda which tastes most strongly of kola nut, which is the dominant flavor in the standard 1893 product.  Where they are different is that the line of 1893 products contain sugar.  This most strongly contributes to a heavier mouthfeel with the 1893, which is actually a good thing, as it helps to accentuate the flavor.<br /><br />For the 1893 Ginger Cola, you essentially are looking at an original 1893 Cola crossed with a ginger beer.  Those expecting something more in the ginger ale family instead of a ginger beer will likely not like this product.  It has an assertive ginger flavor, much like a Reed's Ginger Beer.  The ginger almost, but not completely, overpowers the kola nut flavor.  Enough of the kola nut flavor remains to set it apart from just being a ginger beer.<br /><br />Overall, both products in the 1893 line are high-quality soda products that I expect to not last in the marketplace long.  What makes these products great is the quality of the ingredients, and what will kill it is that the retail price is generally too high for a product that most consumers will pass up.  I just do not see the average consumer paying more for a twelve pack of soda than they would pay for a twelve pack of good beer.  Personally, I enjoy good soda and limit my intake to a single serving per day.  So, I will continue to have a few of these on-hand, and hope to be wrong about its ultimate fate.",5

While some will swoon over this drink or that, for me it has always been Pepsi, in an actual glass (no plastic) served very cold (34 degrees Fahrenheit) and served over ice.  For me that is just about a perfect treat.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this new Pepsi revival by 1893.  I'm pleased to report that this beverage does meet expectations.<br /><br />This is a special occasion beverage.  Like gathering with friends to split the big sandwich or smoke cigars or play poker, this new &#34;Pepsi&#34; 1893 is an occasional beverage.  You won't be gulping this down by the gallon at the movie theater.<br /><br />This has a spicy pallet, the real ginger and real Kola nut are very present and flavorful.  The ginger after taste lingers for a long while.<br /><br />In my experiments this beverage also improves when served cold, in a glass, over ice.<br /><br />This is a fantastic revival and a glorious occasional beverage.  Try it and see for yourself how real Pepsi can be.<br /><br />Cheers ",5

B01D4B21KS,"on June 5, 2016",A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0,"1893 ""Original Cola"" review--added a little about 1893 Ginger Cola, too","It's too bad that Amazon groups the 1893 Original Cola and the 1893 Ginger Cola on the same product review page. I ordered the original but was confused by the reviews into thinking it would have a strong ginger flavor, like ginger ale.<br /><br />Happily, the Original Cola doesn't have -any- ginger flavor, although it IS a bit different from regular Pepsi. The ingredients have been tweaked back to the 1893 recipe (a very cool idea), and now include kola nut extract and dark brown malt flavor.  These taste similar to Pepsi but not as sweet (this is a very good thing) and what my family called a &#34;more well rounded flavor&#34;. I would say it has a slight bitterness (perhaps from the malt and kola nut) without being bitter.<br /><br />It also doesn't use any high fructose corn syrup. Instead, it is sweetened with fair trade cane sugar--always an improvement. I really was surprised how much we all liked this. It is refreshing, and although it is still sweet, it tastes natural and maybe half or a third as intensely sweet as regular Pepsi. It's about $2 a can which is more than regular Pepsi, but to me, it's worth it. I like it a lot--very refreshing without that overdone sweetness of regular Pepsi or Coke. I hope they keep it around.<br /><br />6.20.16.  Edited to add:  We liked the 1893 &#34;Original Cola&#34; so much that we bought a can of 1893 Ginger Cola when we saw it in the market yesterday. After reading the reviews here, I didn't expect to like it. While I like ginger in food, and even in tea, I'm not really fond of ginger ale and some of the reviews made this sound &#34;too ginger-y&#34;, too.  So...surprise! My (adult) family and I liked the 1893 Ginger Cola a lot, too (I'm not sure if kids would find it too different from the sodas they're used to just because (1) it's not as sweet and (2) they probably have little experience with ginger flavoring in anything yet.)  What I liked was that it was less sweet than regular colas. It still has sweetness, but not so much. I appreciated that (the same reason I like drinks like Squirt or root beers--there's a balance in flavor that just seems more &#34;for adults&#34; somehow than sweet coke or pepsi. I know some reviewers found the ginger flavor overpowering, but I didn't feel that way. The smell is strongly of ginger, but the flavor is not that aggressive to me, maybe a little like root beer or Dr. Pepper in that its obviously a sugar-based fizzy drink, but there's some interestingly complex flavor, not just that strong sugar.  Anyway, the market sold them as single cans so if you like ginger at all--and, again, I didn't think it was anything like the punch of ginger in ginger ale, fortunately--it's well worth a try.",5
B01D4B21KS,"on June 5, 2016",A3LR0Y3LGKAND4,"It's not you Ginger Cola, it is me.....","First off, I was avoiding purchasing these new Pepsi products due to the price in my stores $1.30-$1.80 a can!  Being taken for a ride by a large corporation wasn't in my list of things to do.  That said, I was able to get a 12-pack for $9.00 shipped from Amazon so I thought why not.  I know a few people who want to try it so I can always share.<br /><br />I am going to sum up the review into one word: Ginger.  If you are not a huge fan of the ginger taste, aftertaste and lingering &#34;burn&#34;, don't even bother.  Most sodas claiming a ginger flavor are extremely weak and hardly, if at all, taste like it.  This on the other hand will not let you forget the primary punch.<br /><br />The initial smell alerts you quickly that this is a legitimate ginger soda, and that they were not kidding when they said it contains real ginger.  I immediately began thinking about ginger snaps! (mmmmmmmmmm)  Then came the first sip. A decent ginger note hit me followed by a strong aftertaste.  After drinking about half the can, I waited a few minutes before having any more.  During this period, the carbonation fizz feeling left and the burn from real ginger remained.<br /><br />Then I started thinking.  Do I really want all the ginger character in a drink?  Ginger snaps and other treats have always been a favorite, but something about the same sensations didn't feel right. It's very pleasing that I am having a soda that truly has the REAL flavor it claims, but I couldn't help but remain empty.  It wasn't really satisfying.<br /><br />I almost feel bad giving it a 3-star because it really did a great job at creating a true ginger soda.  Though in doing so, I realized that it is something I don't really want.<br /><br />I hope to mix this in drinks as some interesting creations surely await. That said, as just a soda, this 12-pack is going to be shared quite a bit.",3
B01D4B21KS,"on June 5, 2016",A3NQU1649SH0Q4,"I like regular Pepsi.  This isn't much different, but it costs a good deal more","The official name of this product is &#34;1893 from the makers of Pepsi-Cola&#34; (black can).  Other than the fact that it's sweetened with cane sugar and a little more complex in flavor, I can't see much improvement over regular (non-Diet) Pepsi-Cola that is sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup.  It certainly costs a lot more.  Since Mexican Coca-Cola (sweetened with sugar) is already widely available, and since this beverage does not come enhanced with nutrients like Guarine or vitamins like Red Bull or Rockstar, I'm not sure why it was introduced.  My hunch is that it will not last long, except possibly as a niche-of-a-niche marketing device.  I much preferred the Pepsi &#34;Holiday Spice&#34; that was introduced three Christmas seasons ago and then disappeared without a trace.",4
B01D4B21KS,"on June 3, 2016",A287I0B80QSD92,"Not for everyone but if you like a unique experience, well worth it!","I purchased the Ginger Cola variety based on a recommendation from a friend. I'm a fan of ginger so I figured it was worth a shot. Upon trying the first one, I was surprised by the powerful taste of what I assume is the kola nut, which is then followed up by the ginger taste. I didn't know at first if this would be something that quite suited me but I kept on with it and finished the first one over ice. Later that day, I tried a second one, which had time by that point to get cold in the fridge. This was the point at which the cola started to win me over. It's a very distrinct flavor profile and probably not for everyone. But the distinctness is what I love. I haven't yet had a chance to try it with bourbon but that's on my list! Even just straight out of the can, this is a great mix of unique flavors. It's not overwhelming, at least not to my tongue. But it lingers with you and maybe it's the caffiene or just me as a soda junkie, but I want more and more of it. Please, Pepsi, don't kill this off prematurely! This soda has a solid place on store shelves and I'd hate to see it retired to the big grave yard of colas along with the likes of Pepsi Crystal, Summer Mix, and Holiday Spice.",5

I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I had seen some commercials and my interest was piqued. The cola portion itself is not bad, but it has a strong ginger effect that I wasn't really ready for. Maybe after a few more cans I'll adjust my stance, but at the moment, I prefer regular pepsi (with sugar) or coke (with sugar) a bit more.

B01D4B21KS,"on May 12, 2016",A3DYWU6Y7Q5094,"Very similar-tasting to regular Pepsi -, despite costing considerably more.","I PERSONALLY HAVE TRIED the new Pepsi &#34;1893 Cola&#34; on repeated occasions. On the can's label, it mentions about having (1) &#34;real cola-extract&#34;, (2) &#34;dark brown malt flavor&#34;, (3) and &#34;a touch of 'bitters' &#34; -, so I was EXPECTING it to taste noticeably higher-quality and generally different than (for instance) the &#34;with real sugar&#34; Pepsi that I routinely drink these-days. (The &#34;1893&#34; version is ALSO sweetened with &#34;real sugar&#34; , &#34;fair-trade certified real sugar&#34;, to be exact.) In-actuality, I concluded that the &#34;1893&#34; tastes DECIDELY SIMLIAR to the regular &#34;with real sugar&#34; version. However, it does have a slightly more &#34;complex&#34; flavor, which was the only sign of the reputed &#34;malt&#34; or &#34;cola extract&#34; listed in its ingredients. (Many of the YouTube &#34;video reviews&#34; that I've belatedly seen about this product seem to have likewise come to that conclusion). Frankly, I found that the &#34;bitters&#34; seemed to give the product a &#34;bitter aftertaste&#34; -, much as-if it had some &#34;artificial sweetener&#34; in it. The product does have slightly more viscosity &#34;body&#34; to it -, much the way that root-beers often have more &#34;body&#34;. This characteristic is apparently due to this product having &#34;gum Arabic&#34; in its formula -, which gives it a better &#34;mouth feel&#34;, but also tends to make this cola especially apt to &#34;foam in your esophagus&#34;. Finally for this portion of my &#34;review&#34; -, let me say that I've seen it opined that this product may be more suitable as an &#34;alcoholic 'mixer' &#34;; but since I personally would primarily intend for it to be drank &#34;as is&#34;, then this possible &#34;mixer&#34; usage would typically not apply to me.<br />~ All-things-considered -, I was somewhat disappointed in this &#34;1893&#34; Cola -, especially since (at my local Wal-Mart) it COSTS $1.68 per can (not including sales-tax) -, as opposed to about $1.00 per glass-bottle for the regular &#34;with real sugar&#34; version. In-fact, the only reason that I MIGHT buy this product in the future, is that it has a somewhat lower amount of caffeine than the regular (sugar) Pepsi -, and I have been hoping to decease my caffeine intake AND yet still be able to drink a &#34;real sugar&#34; cola. Oh well, if at some time you try a can of this product for yourself -, perhaps you should take-into-consideration these observations that I've expressed here.<br />~ Finally, I gave this &#34;1893 Cola&#34; only 3-out-of-5 &#34;stars&#34; -, because (1) I felt that it actually tasted slightly worse than the regular &#34;with real sugar&#34; Pepsi (mainly due to the &#34;bitter aftertaste&#34; circumstance), and (2) because it is none-the-less &#34;over-priced&#34; -, even compared to the other &#34;real sugar&#34; Pepsi, let-alone compared to the H.F.C.S-formula Pepsi.<br />[Note: This is the &#34;edited&#34; version of my review -, which was revised by me on May 16th, 2016 -, in order to correct some inaccuracies in my original posting from the preceding May 12th.]",3

All six cases I ordered of the combo ended up having some dents in the cans; around 10 cans have severe dents that will make them hard to open, and two cans popped and drained.

There are some out there that have that immediate bite of ginger but not the root like lingering flavor. This ginger cola doesn't burn immediately, it slowly build up the spice but what is clear from the first sip is the true flavor of ginger. You get that root/dirt/ash like lingering flavor when you eat real ginger. This tastes GREAT<br /><br />Update: I drank the Cola today and it was a nostalgic experience. When I was a kid in the 80s living in Iran and traveling the middle east and europe... I would drink pepsi, coke, and fanta. The flavors popped and it was so delicious. At some point when I moved to the USA, and around the world in general, soda became flat in flavor. I think it probably has to do with corn syrup. This 1893 Cola reminds of when I was a kid in Iran going to the corner store on a hot dau after a soccer match and drinking an ice cold pepsi straight from the glass bottle. This cola has quite a depth of flavor, you can identify the malt and kola nut. This tastes great and its amazing the difference between normal pepsi/coke. You can actually tell there are multiple flavors and they pop while regular soda has a flavor that is very one dimensional and flat.<br /><br />This is something I would drink when I'm thirsty or want something tasty treat myself too, I wouldn't really drink this with food or salty snacks only because the complex flavors would probably get over powered by what ever it was you were eating.

So, you can see we are fans.<br /><br />I bought the 1893 4-pack a while ago figuring this would be a treat. My son and I had the same reaction ... tastes like medicine ... it's downright AWFUL! I guess there was a reason they changed the formula. I know the reason for high fructose corn syrup change ... economics after Earl Butts tried to help the corn farmer. Before that department of agriculture decision, your soda had real sugar and you beef was grass fed. I am guessing the reason for the 1893 change to the modern  formula was it tasted really bad.<br /><br />Some may like this but for us, we will stick to the real sugar varieties.

Besides the regular Pepsi, my two other favorites was Pepsi w/real sugar and the Throwback Pepsi. This 1893 has moved them all back, this is #1, this is By Far the BEST PEPSI Product they have ever made, (in my opinion). I pray that Pepsi doesn't take this away and makes it a regular item, like other regular Pepsi products. It tastes like a darker and richer RC cola, with some malty-ness to it, it has a nice bite that is left on your palette and doesn't seem quite as sweet as regular Pepsi, but it does have the same amount of sugar. OMG It's just fantastic. If I didn't love Pepsi so much I would have given 4 stars instead of 5 due to two of the 12 packs came broken, and so far 2 cans are messed up on top.

Someone in the Pepsi Co. marketing department really did their research to know what would invoke a strong feeling of nostalgia and eye appeal along with some great descriptors.  I could've done without the additions of the typical mass-produced cola junk ingredients like caramel coloring and potassium sorbate though (smaller production colas don't typically have these anymore).<br /><br />It is far from the more &#34;complex&#34; taste (my words not the marketing) that I imagined it to have based on the description.  However, the taste is a bit more pronounced then a regular dark cola drink with a slight aroma to the nose of those bitters, which is interesting.  The aftertaste definitely lingers longer than a regular cola and has more mouth appeal in terms of the residual flavors - this is where you can really taste the anise, pomander, and other citrus-esque notes that will typically come out of a cola drink and here is where it excels in my opinion.  I think it is much more sophisticated than a typical Coke or Pepsi, but I doubt the general population will gravitate to it as their &#34;go-to&#34; cola drink.  As is the case with this review and the others here on Amazon, it is probably going to be a bigger hit with crowds that appreciate unique cola drinks that play on a variety of your senses.",4

B01D4B2EF0,"on July 26, 2016",AJ7FZJAFWR26T,Great marketing strategy - interesting cola drink,"I liked the concept of the 1893 recipe complete with Kola extract, real cane sugar, a touch of aromatic bitters, and the elongated can that has almost a neo-Victorian style to it.  Someone in the Pepsi Co. marketing department really did their research to know what would invoke a strong feeling of nostalgia and eye appeal along with some great descriptors.  I could've done without the additions of the typical mass-produced cola junk ingredients like caramel coloring and potassium sorbate though (smaller production colas don't typically have these anymore).<br /><br />It is far from the more &#34;complex&#34; taste (my words not the marketing) that I imagined it to have based on the description.  However, the taste is a bit more pronounced then a regular dark cola drink with a slight aroma to the nose of those bitters, which is interesting.  The aftertaste definitely lingers longer than a regular cola and has more mouth appeal in terms of the residual flavors - this is where you can really taste the anise, pomander, and other citrus-esque notes that will typically come out of a cola drink and here is where it excels in my opinion.  I think it is much more sophisticated than a typical Coke or Pepsi, but I doubt the general population will gravitate to it as their &#34;go-to&#34; cola drink.  As is the case with this review and the others here on Amazon, it is probably going to be a bigger hit with crowds that appreciate unique cola drinks that play on a variety of your senses.",4

However I do really like ginger ale so this product intrigued me. First you may with to note that all of the ingredients on the label are simple, easy to pronounce names. Second the cans are not the same size as standard cans they are taller (I'll attach a photo to show that as well). Each can does have 12 ounce, I know because I poured mine into a 12 oz beverage glass to check.<br /><br />The flavor is still cola but there is a very strong ginger flavor that makes it acceptable to me. I actually enjoyed drinking one of these! Each can has 150 calories however so it is not the sort of treat to have regularly unless you regularly drink soda pop. My entire family really enjoyed these, too, the one who loves colas and the one who is just meh about colas. The ginger really made a difference.<br /><br />Warning: The box says it contains 12 cans but the one I was sent to review only had 10 cans; I'll include a photo to show you. Since the box was inside another box and this box was damaged when I received it, it suggests that the missing cans had to have gone missing from within Amazon itself. Did someone take them?

It's about time!<br /><br />The cola itself gets 5 stars, obviously, but I just have to state my opinion about a couple of things.<br /><br />1. I couldn't find it in my local grocery store, or even at the &#34;big box&#34; store!? I only found it at the local convenience store. I had probably passed right by it before, not even realizing what it was. Because of the placement, and also because of the shape of the can, I'm guessing that an awful lot of people just pass right by it thinking it's just another stupid energy drink in a tall black can.<br /><br />In my opinion, this soda needs to be on store shelves right next to the Pepsi and Dr. Pepper. It ought to be in the same 12-packs of cans that those sodas come in. Now, I understand if the price is just a little higher because of the real sugar and natural kola nut extract, and all of that stuff. OK, so maybe it's 5 or 6 dollars per 12-pack, rather than the 3 dollars we're used to with Coke and Pepsi. I'm OK with that, but you have to put it in packaging that people will associate with &#34;cola&#34;, rather than just hiding it away in convenience stores in &#34;energy drink&#34; style cans. Most people will not even bother seeking it out to try it if they don't even know what it's supposed to be.<br /><br />It's COLA, so put it where other colas are sold.<br /><br />2. This is more of a personal thing. I'm trying to cut back on sugar, whether it be the &#34;high fructose corn syrup&#34; variety, or the real sugar like 1893 has. As much as I love this stuff, I don't drink it, or any other sugared soda very often for that reason. That's why I am really hoping that we will soon see a &#34;low sugar&#34; version of this soda. We now know that it is possible to create a lower sugar version of a soda that is virtually indistinguishable from the high sugar version, thanks to Dr. Pepper Ten. I sincerely hope that using some combination of sucralose, stevia, monk fruit, and real sugar, we will soon be able to enjoy this same flavor without so much sugar intake.<br /><br />And everything I said pretty much goes for the ginger version as well. That stuff is great too!<br /><br />So, in a nutshell, put this soda where it belongs, right there on the grocery store soda shelf, charge just a little more for it, because it is worth it, and get to working on that low-sugar version.",5

That said...<br /><br />What we have here is, at least supposedly, is the the way the drink was originally made when the company first came about (apparently called 'Brad's Drink'). Honestly I doubt it tasted the same. But that's irrelevant -- the result is very satisfying, possibly a combination of the kola nut extract along with using -- most importantly -- real sugar instead of that HFCS crap.<br />There's not much else to say. It still tastes like Pepsi but without that underlying overly sweet bit that makes we not like it so much. So it actually makes for a satisfying drink experience.<br />One thing to note -- cans are taller and thinner than normal soda cans, though it's still 12oz each.

I might try the original version but another concern is that this version barely arrived in the box.  The external Amazon box was in decent condition but the inner box was beaten up, ripped and the cans were about to spill loose.  One can was heavily dented.  Luckily none of them leaked.

It's the real thing and just strong enough to have a bit of bite without having the strong ginger burn too. But what I really enjoy is the use of real sugar and not HFCS. For me it's not just about what is or isn't healthy, but rather a plethora of food sensitivities and intolerance.<br /><br />Food coloring is one thing I have issues with, HFCS is another. And since most sodas use corn syrup, I don't drink many. But Pepsi 1893 uses real sugar, ginger and kola nuts for its flavor, not high fructose corn syrup which is found in regular Pepsi, and you can tell the difference. Each of these flavors stand out rather than get lost or being overshadowed by another. I'm enjoying this ginger version of Pepsi 1893 so much that once I've finished this pack, I'm planning on buying a pack of the original flavor as well to try out.",5

Here, the presence of real sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup improves the overall product, and the taste is a little less sugary-syrup-sweet. That part is great.

Exec Summary:  Amazingly good beverage, high recommend!","Before we begin, I mentioned to a couple of people that I was trying the new 1893 beverage from Pepsi. For the record, and because three out of three friends asked me the question, no, I dont think theres cocaine in itand I believe that story was about Coke, not Pepsi, as verified through Snopes. Even then, there was very little cocaine in the Coke (according to Snopes, in 1902, cocaine was as little as 1/400 of a grain of the drug (roughly fluid extract of Coco leaves) though it took until 1929 to become free of it. As far as I can tell, Pepsi never contained it.<br /><br />So, that aside, lets talk about the new 1893 soda, named for the first year that PepsiCo was founded.  First, its delicious.  Theres none of the cloying fructose taste.  The ingredients, from the can contain Kola nut extract, dark brown malt flavor, aromatic bitters, sparkling water and real sugar. Thats the baseline ingredients. From the can also: carbonated water, fair trade cane sugar, caramel color, phosphoric acid, sodium citrate, natural flavor (whatever that is,) potassium sorbate (preserving freshness,) caffeine (34 mg per 12 fl oz can,) gum arabic, Kola nut extract.  So two different ingredient lists on one cansorry if youre not sure why theres two; Im uncertain myself. Theres also 150 calories in a can, with 40 grams of carbs of which 39 grams are from sugar.<br /><br />You can taste the difference from regular pepsi (which I usually like) and this (which I think I love.)  Awesome taste.<br /><br />The can (see the picture) is tall, brown and would look vintage-y, except for the Pepsi logo painted on its side. There is also a Ginger Cola 1893 brand, its cans are a copper color.<br /><br />The can pours well, the soda pops satisfactorily and the taste is delicious.  It looks and smells like regular Pepsi but tastes much better.  The sweetness isnt cloying, a little earthier (possibly the bitters at work with Kola extract for nuttiness. It would probably go good as a strong drink mixer, the flavors are working overtime and would nicely offset rum, for example. My understanding is that PepsiCo is considering launching a restaurant brand, opening eateries in NYC.  This will likely be featured prominently in its beverages, both virgin and non-virgin.<br /><br />All in all, the beverage is everything I like about regular Pepsi, and it tastes quite a bit better!

By spicy, I mean a lot of spices.  In particular, I noticed a cinammon taste.  If you've had Fireball Whiskey, it is a familiar cinnamon taste to that.  It took a bit of getting used to, but I grew to like the stronger flavor.  I also appreciate that this is using real sugar, and other real ingredients.  Pepsi really seems to be leading the charge on this front, with products like this and also Throwback Pepsi.<br /><br />I also tried mixing this with Jack Daniels whiskey (Jack and Coke is the best drink ever!).  I was hoping the stronger flavor of this pepsi would compliment the flavors in Jack, but I actually couldn't tell a difference between this and a normal Jack and Coke.  So save the cheaper pop for your drinking!!",4

The ginger flavor is decent; it doesn't taste like a &#34;flavoring&#34;.  The base of the drink is very much a traditional cola in the spirit of Pepsi Cola.  They seem to have put in an effort to make this upscale (&#34;real sugar&#34;), but one consequence of this swankiness is that the cans will not fit securely in the cup holders in your car.  Instead, each can is taller and thinner than a regular 12oz can.<br /><br />The product has no caffeine.",3

May go good with an upscale party. I poured it over ice. The carbonation is low. The flavor is well balanced and smooth on the tongue. The overall taste is tempered by sugar, but it is not too sweet. I'm not sure if it's the &#34;dark brown malt flavor,&#34; but I think it has a more sophisticated taste. No bad aftertaste. If you like the idea that &#34;more than 80% fair trade certified ingredients,&#34; that makes it even better.

The 12 ounce cans are made the same as the energy drink cans, taller and slimmer than the cans you would get from a soda machine.<br />I recommend this Pepsi Cola 1893 for anybody who likes to try different soft drinks.

However, I probably won't buy again, simply because it's full sugar (150 calories and lots of carbs)--to me, I don't want to waste the calories and carbs on a soft drink. However, if that doesn't bother you or your metabolism, I highly recommend Pepsi 1893. It really is good stuff. I wish I could have it all the time. Received for free for review.",5
B01D4B2EF0,"on June 8, 2016",A20CQ20J30DJZT,Tastes Like Coke from the Olden Days,"It tastes a lot like regular, traditional Coca Cola from before the days of HFCS. It doesn't taste at all like any Pepsi I've ever had, although I'm just 55, so I don't go back as far as this drink purportedly goes back.<br /><br />I don't like the tall, skinny cans. They're not retro. Aluminum cans for soft drinks only go back to the '60s, and even tin cans for soft drinks goes back to the '30s. In 1893, it would have been most likely to have it as a syrup, and added to carbonated water at serving time, but if it was going to be sold ready-to-drink, it would have been a bottle.<br /><br />So what's the point of the tall can? To make sure people know it's not an &#34;ordinary&#34; soft drink? To cement the idea that you don't buy this for everyday consumption? Can it really be successful if it's only being positioned as a special occasion cola? Especially if it doesn't taste much different than regular Coke?<br /><br />I'm not so into looking trendy by holding their unique can that I'd be willing to pay a premium price. It's a soft drink. Just put it in a can that fits in my refrigerator, and isn't so skinny that it tips over in a cup holder in my car.<br /><br />So it's okay. Just nothing special.",3

B01D4B2EF0,"on June 8, 2016",A141W8WHW9AC3H,Strong real ginger flavor with subtle cola notes,"Beware: this ain't your average ginger ale taste!  If you don't like a strong ginger taste, you won't like this.  If (like me) you love ginger, this is a welcome new soda that's been a long time coming.<br /><br />I would describe this as mainly a strongly ginger flavored soda -- there is a cola taste too, but it is quite subtle.  You taste it more after you swallow it, after the initial burn of the ginger has subsided.  It's not just like they mixed half Pepsi and half ginger ale (if anything it's more like 90% ginger and 10% Pepsi, but the ginger is far stronger than any ginger ale I've had before).<br /><br />The ingredients are: water, sugar, caramel color, natural flavor, phosphoric acid, sodium citrate, caffeine, potassium sorbate, modified food starch, kola nut extract, ginger oleoresin.<br /><br />38 mg of caffeine is in one 12 oz can.<br /><br />Calories: 150<br />Total carbohydrates: 40 g<br />Sugars: 39 g<br /><br />Oh, I looked up one ingredient -- &quot;ginger oleoresin&quot; is apparently a natural sort of extract of ginger, they use CO2 to get as much ginger flavor in liquid form as possible out of the ginger root.  It's quite clear from drinking this that there virtually HAD to be real ginger in it, because you just don't get that specific taste and burn from anything else.  I sometimes take a chunk of ginger root and squeeze out the juice from it (using a garlic press) into water or tea to get a &quot;shot&quot; of real ginger to settle my stomach...this tastes exactly like that ginger.<br /><br />This tastes better with every can...it's not something you'd want to chug down on a hot day, but it's perfect for enjoying after dinner, possibly in a mixed drink.  Great to have on hand for a party (but not for kids).",5
B01D4B2EF0,"on June 8, 2016",AK48G4QVPH3Y7,Refreshingly Different and High-Quality,"Pepsi's 1893 Ginger Cola offering is a refreshing take on bringing a new product line to the public.  Both the Ginger Cola and Cola have a taste that can be considered as being distinctly different than the Pepsi flagship brand.  In order to fully appreciate the flavor profile of the Ginger Cola, it helps to have tried the original 1893 Cola, as well.<br /><br />The original 1893 Cola is described as containing kola nut extract, a malty flavor, aromatic bitters, pure sugar, and carbonated water.  As to what it actually tastes like, the closest comparison that could be drawn is that it tastes like a more deeply flavored Royal Crown (RC) Cola.  RC definitely has the soda which tastes most strongly of kola nut, which is the dominant flavor in the standard 1893 product.  Where they are different is that the line of 1893 products contain sugar.  This most strongly contributes to a heavier mouthfeel with the 1893, which is actually a good thing, as it helps to accentuate the flavor.<br /><br />For the 1893 Ginger Cola, you essentially are looking at an original 1893 Cola crossed with a ginger beer.  Those expecting something more in the ginger ale family instead of a ginger beer will likely not like this product.  It has an assertive ginger flavor, much like a Reed's Ginger Beer.  The ginger almost, but not completely, overpowers the kola nut flavor.  Enough of the kola nut flavor remains to set it apart from just being a ginger beer.<br /><br />Overall, both products in the 1893 line are high-quality soda products that I expect to not last in the marketplace long.  What makes these products great is the quality of the ingredients, and what will kill it is that the retail price is generally too high for a product that most consumers will pass up.  I just do not see the average consumer paying more for a twelve pack of soda than they would pay for a twelve pack of good beer.  Personally, I enjoy good soda and limit my intake to a single serving per day.  So, I will continue to have a few of these on-hand, and hope to be wrong about its ultimate fate.",5

While some will swoon over this drink or that, for me it has always been Pepsi, in an actual glass (no plastic) served very cold (34 degrees Fahrenheit) and served over ice.  For me that is just about a perfect treat.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this new Pepsi revival by 1893.  I'm pleased to report that this beverage does meet expectations.<br /><br />This is a special occasion beverage.  Like gathering with friends to split the big sandwich or smoke cigars or play poker, this new &#34;Pepsi&#34; 1893 is an occasional beverage.  You won't be gulping this down by the gallon at the movie theater.<br /><br />This has a spicy pallet, the real ginger and real Kola nut are very present and flavorful.  The ginger after taste lingers for a long while.<br /><br />In my experiments this beverage also improves when served cold, in a glass, over ice.<br /><br />This is a fantastic revival and a glorious occasional beverage.

B01D4B2EF0,"on June 5, 2016",A1LKOIZXPQ9VG0,"1893 ""Original Cola"" review--added a little about 1893 Ginger Cola, too","It's too bad that Amazon groups the 1893 Original Cola and the 1893 Ginger Cola on the same product review page. I ordered the original but was confused by the reviews into thinking it would have a strong ginger flavor, like ginger ale.<br /><br />Happily, the Original Cola doesn't have -any- ginger flavor, although it IS a bit different from regular Pepsi. The ingredients have been tweaked back to the 1893 recipe (a very cool idea), and now include kola nut extract and dark brown malt flavor.  These taste similar to Pepsi but not as sweet (this is a very good thing) and what my family called a &#34;more well rounded flavor&#34;. I would say it has a slight bitterness (perhaps from the malt and kola nut) without being bitter.<br /><br />It also doesn't use any high fructose corn syrup. Instead, it is sweetened with fair trade cane sugar--always an improvement. I really was surprised how much we all liked this. It is refreshing, and although it is still sweet, it tastes natural and maybe half or a third as intensely sweet as regular Pepsi. It's about $2 a can which is more than regular Pepsi, but to me, it's worth it. I like it a lot--very refreshing without that overdone sweetness of regular Pepsi or Coke. I hope they keep it around.<br /><br />6.20.16.  Edited to add:  We liked the 1893 &#34;Original Cola&#34; so much that we bought a can of 1893 Ginger Cola when we saw it in the market yesterday. After reading the reviews here, I didn't expect to like it. While I like ginger in food, and even in tea, I'm not really fond of ginger ale and some of the reviews made this sound &#34;too ginger-y&#34;, too.  So...surprise! My (adult) family and I liked the 1893 Ginger Cola a lot, too (I'm not sure if kids would find it too different from the sodas they're used to just because (1) it's not as sweet and (2) they probably have little experience with ginger flavoring in anything yet.)  What I liked was that it was less sweet than regular colas. It still has sweetness, but not so much. I appreciated that (the same reason I like drinks like Squirt or root beers--there's a balance in flavor that just seems more &#34;for adults&#34; somehow than sweet coke or pepsi. I know some reviewers found the ginger flavor overpowering, but I didn't feel that way. The smell is strongly of ginger, but the flavor is not that aggressive to me, maybe a little like root beer or Dr. Pepper in that its obviously a sugar-based fizzy drink, but there's some interestingly complex flavor, not just that strong sugar.  Anyway, the market sold them as single cans so if you like ginger at all--and, again, I didn't think it was anything like the punch of ginger in ginger ale, fortunately--it's well worth a try.",5

Being taken for a ride by a large corporation wasn't in my list of things to do.  That said, I was able to get a 12-pack for $9.00 shipped from Amazon so I thought why not.  I know a few people who want to try it so I can always share.<br /><br />I am going to sum up the review into one word: Ginger.  If you are not a huge fan of the ginger taste, aftertaste and lingering &#34;burn&#34;, don't even bother.  Most sodas claiming a ginger flavor are extremely weak and hardly, if at all, taste like it.  This on the other hand will not let you forget the primary punch.<br /><br />The initial smell alerts you quickly that this is a legitimate ginger soda, and that they were not kidding when they said it contains real ginger.  I immediately began thinking about ginger snaps! (mmmmmmmmmm)  Then came the first sip. A decent ginger note hit me followed by a strong aftertaste.  After drinking about half the can, I waited a few minutes before having any more.  During this period, the carbonation fizz feeling left and the burn from real ginger remained.<br /><br />Then I started thinking.  Do I really want all the ginger character in a drink?  Ginger snaps and other treats have always been a favorite, but something about the same sensations didn't feel right. It's very pleasing that I am having a soda that truly has the REAL flavor it claims, but I couldn't help but remain empty.  It wasn't really satisfying.<br /><br />I almost feel bad giving it a 3-star because it really did a great job at creating a true ginger soda.  Though in doing so, I realized that it is something I don't really want.<br /><br />I hope to mix this in drinks as some interesting creations surely await.

This isn't much different, but it costs a good deal more","The official name of this product is &#34;1893 from the makers of Pepsi-Cola&#34; (black can).  Other than the fact that it's sweetened with cane sugar and a little more complex in flavor, I can't see much improvement over regular (non-Diet) Pepsi-Cola that is sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup.  It certainly costs a lot more.  Since Mexican Coca-Cola (sweetened with sugar) is already widely available, and since this beverage does not come enhanced with nutrients like Guarine or vitamins like Red Bull or Rockstar, I'm not sure why it was introduced.  My hunch is that it will not last long, except possibly as a niche-of-a-niche marketing device.

I'm a fan of ginger so I figured it was worth a shot. Upon trying the first one, I was surprised by the powerful taste of what I assume is the kola nut, which is then followed up by the ginger taste. I didn't know at first if this would be something that quite suited me but I kept on with it and finished the first one over ice. Later that day, I tried a second one, which had time by that point to get cold in the fridge. This was the point at which the cola started to win me over. It's a very distrinct flavor profile and probably not for everyone. But the distinctness is what I love. I haven't yet had a chance to try it with bourbon but that's on my list! Even just straight out of the can, this is a great mix of unique flavors. It's not overwhelming, at least not to my tongue. But it lingers with you and maybe it's the caffiene or just me as a soda junkie, but I want more and more of it. Please, Pepsi, don't kill this off prematurely! This soda has a solid place on store shelves and I'd hate to see it retired to the big grave yard of colas along with the likes of Pepsi Crystal, Summer Mix, and Holiday Spice.",5

On the can's label, it mentions about having (1) &#34;real cola-extract&#34;, (2) &#34;dark brown malt flavor&#34;, (3) and &#34;a touch of 'bitters' &#34; -, so I was EXPECTING it to taste noticeably higher-quality and generally different than (for instance) the &#34;with real sugar&#34; Pepsi that I routinely drink these-days. (The &#34;1893&#34; version is ALSO sweetened with &#34;real sugar&#34; , &#34;fair-trade certified real sugar&#34;, to be exact.) In-actuality, I concluded that the &#34;1893&#34; tastes DECIDELY SIMLIAR to the regular &#34;with real sugar&#34; version. However, it does have a slightly more &#34;complex&#34; flavor, which was the only sign of the reputed &#34;malt&#34; or &#34;cola extract&#34; listed in its ingredients. (Many of the YouTube &#34;video reviews&#34; that I've belatedly seen about this product seem to have likewise come to that conclusion). Frankly, I found that the &#34;bitters&#34; seemed to give the product a &#34;bitter aftertaste&#34; -, much as-if it had some &#34;artificial sweetener&#34; in it. The product does have slightly more viscosity &#34;body&#34; to it -, much the way that root-beers often have more &#34;body&#34;. This characteristic is apparently due to this product having &#34;gum Arabic&#34; in its formula -, which gives it a better &#34;mouth feel&#34;, but also tends to make this cola especially apt to &#34;foam in your esophagus&#34;. Finally for this portion of my &#34;review&#34; -, let me say that I've seen it opined that this product may be more suitable as an &#34;alcoholic 'mixer' &#34;; but since I personally would primarily intend for it to be drank &#34;as is&#34;, then this possible &#34;mixer&#34; usage would typically not apply to me.<br />~ All-things-considered -, I was somewhat disappointed in this &#34;1893&#34; Cola -, especially since (at my local Wal-Mart) it COSTS $1.68 per can (not including sales-tax) -, as opposed to about $1.00 per glass-bottle for the regular &#34;with real sugar&#34; version. In-fact, the only reason that I MIGHT buy this product in the future, is that it has a somewhat lower amount of caffeine than the regular (sugar) Pepsi -, and I have been hoping to decease my caffeine intake AND yet still be able to drink a &#34;real sugar&#34; cola. Oh well, if at some time you try a can of this product for yourself -, perhaps you should take-into-consideration these observations that I've expressed here.<br />~ Finally, I gave this &#34;1893 Cola&#34; only 3-out-of-5 &#34;stars&#34; -, because (1) I felt that it actually tasted slightly worse than the regular &#34;with real sugar&#34; Pepsi (mainly due to the &#34;bitter aftertaste&#34; circumstance), and (2) because it is none-the-less &#34;over-priced&#34; -, even compared to the other &#34;real sugar&#34; Pepsi, let-alone compared to the H.F.C.S-formula Pepsi.<br />[Note: This is the &#34;edited&#34; version of my review -, which was revised by me on May 16th, 2016 -, in order to correct some inaccuracies in my original posting from the preceding May 12th.]",3

The ginger version adds a nice, strong (like ginger beer strong) later on top of it; I love it, but my wife isn't a huge fan.<br /><br />When you have this shipped, at least in a quantity of more than one case, expect some damaged cans, especially with the combo pack. It ships in a cardboard tray with plastic wrap, where the 12 pack of ginger I ordered shipped in a retail box. The retail box was a single case with no damage; I then came back and ordered a bunch of cases of the combo, as when I fall in love with something like this it tends to become unavailable or skyrocket in price.. just my luck. All six cases I ordered of the combo ended up having some dents in the cans; around 10 cans have severe dents that will make them hard to open, and two cans popped and drained. Amazon customer service took care of it (I just let them know how much was damaged), but just be aware going into it..",5
B01D4B2EF0,"on September 27, 2016",AZMGC554NQTXX,Real Deal,"This is the first time I've ever had a ginger cola/gingerale that taste like it had real ginger. There are some out there that have that immediate bite of ginger but not the root like lingering flavor. This ginger cola doesn't burn immediately, it slowly build up the spice but what is clear from the first sip is the true flavor of ginger. You get that root/dirt/ash like lingering flavor when you eat real ginger. This tastes GREAT<br /><br />Update: I drank the Cola today and it was a nostalgic experience. When I was a kid in the 80s living in Iran and traveling the middle east and europe... I would drink pepsi, coke, and fanta. The flavors popped and it was so delicious. At some point when I moved to the USA, and around the world in general, soda became flat in flavor. I think it probably has to do with corn syrup. This 1893 Cola reminds of when I was a kid in Iran going to the corner store on a hot dau after a soccer match and drinking an ice cold pepsi straight from the glass bottle. This cola has quite a depth of flavor, you can identify the malt and kola nut. This tastes great and its amazing the difference between normal pepsi/coke. You can actually tell there are multiple flavors and they pop while regular soda has a flavor that is very one dimensional and flat.<br /><br />This is something I would drink when I'm thirsty or want something tasty treat myself too, I wouldn't really drink this with food or salty snacks only because the complex flavors would probably get over powered by what ever it was you were eating. It's like having a top dollar liquor meant for drinking neat but mixing it in a cocktail instead. Just seems like a waste.",5

After guzzling down a can I let out the most impressive prize-worthy belch I ever did hear. It spanned octaves I didn't even knew I had in me. Needless to say, the cola flavor is a winner.<br /><br />Now onto the ginger flavor.... Just getting through a single can of this stuff was quite painful. Imagine sucking the ginger juice out of a pair of sweat socks boiled in.... well... ginger juice!!!!  The ginger is simply WAY too strong in this beverage. I'm thinking that this ginger cola may have taken out just as many people as Tuberculosis and Diphtheria back in the late 1800's which is why it never made it to the current production lines..... until today apparently.... and I'd swear I almost died somewhere near the last two to three sips left in the can. And the taste doesn't just leave after you've taken your drink. It sits in the back of your throat numbing it for a good 5 minutes reminding you of the mistake you just made.

I guess there was a reason they changed the formula. I know the reason for high fructose corn syrup change ... economics after Earl Butts tried to help the corn farmer. Before that department of agriculture decision, your soda had real sugar and you beef was grass fed.

There's absolutely no way that this is worth the extra cost and lower volume of your normal soda.<br /><br />That was my thought before I drank some. This is now the only (full-sugar) soda that I drink. Everything else just tastes like crap. It even inspired me to start making my own soda and kegging it at home. Good job, Pepsi. This was a solid move and an amazing product!",5
B01D4B2EF0,"on August 8, 2016",A3EA2GC13QBCP9,Too much sugar his the taste.,"The flavor is interesting, what little you can taste of it. It is just too sweet. I doubt that in 1893 they put 39 grams of sugar in a 12 ounce beverage.<br /><br />It tastes like syrup more than soda pop.<br /><br />So it is hard to finish one of the cans.<br /><br />Think of the money they could save by only putting in 20-25 grams of sugar and then you could actually taste the flavors.",3

Not sure how in the world that's possible as I assume they came from the same place.",2

B01D4B2EF0,"on August 6, 2016",A1PO9PT7QF5DXU,"Great ""new"" Pepsi flavor!","Love this &#34;new&#34; flavor! Very refreshing, albeit sweeter tasting version of Pepsi. Doesn't weigh you down either. Definitely a drink that deserves more market visibility. I hope this one hangs around for awhile and does not suffer the same fate as other&#34;specialty&#34; soft drink flavors.",5
B01D4B2EF0,"on August 6, 2016",A2HMSQ5PSEEN2E,"LOVE IT, Best Product that Pepsi has EVER MADE!!!!!!","I Love this new 1893 Pepsi. My bf bought this for me, so I am writing the review. First of all I have been drinking Pepsi for 38 years. I have tried every Pepsi product that has ever come out. Besides the regular Pepsi, my two other favorites was Pepsi w/real sugar and the Throwback Pepsi. This 1893 has moved them all back, this is #1, this is By Far the BEST PEPSI Product they have ever made, (in my opinion). I pray that Pepsi doesn't take this away and makes it a regular item, like other regular Pepsi products. It tastes like a darker and richer RC cola, with some malty-ness to it, it has a nice bite that is left on your palette and doesn't seem quite as sweet as regular Pepsi, but it does have the same amount of sugar. OMG It's just fantastic. If I didn't love Pepsi so much I would have given 4 stars instead of 5 due to two of the 12 packs came broken, and so far 2 cans are messed up on top. Whatever, I can get passed this. It's a shame that it's so dang expensive, it doesn't allow for everyone to be able to try this new Pepsi product. I am definitely going to be Very stingy with my Pepsi's. My BF who isn't a soda drinker let alone a Pepsi drinker really Loved this Product as well. I can't say enough good things about this New 1893 Pepsi, it's FanF****ingTastic!!!! I DO NOT Want this to go away anytime soon, but as I stated before I do hope that it goes to a reasonable price so Everyone can enjoy this great drink!! KUDO's PEPSI You've done it Perfect this time. ^5^5^5^5 Oh and did I mention how much I LOVE, LOVE, Love this new Pepsi?? LOL",5
B01D4B2EF0,"on August 6, 2016",A3VBZDYGHF4NK8,"Outstanding flavor- a ""curated"" feel.  Great as a mixer, or to enjoy on it's own. You will LOVE this unique item!","Love it,  and I hope PepsiCo continues it.<br /><br />The Ginger Cola  has a bit of a &#34;zing&#34; to it, very refreshing, and unexpected.  I have also used it as a mixer for Vodka and Rum drinks.<br /><br />The high-end/high cost of the product  suggests a &#34;curated&#34;  feel.  PepsiCo's 1893 brands are  rare to see in the wild. Only Amazon has 12 packs, as far as I know.<br /><br />This is REALLY good. I am stocking up!<br /><br />There is a well-known hotel bar in LA that uses this as the base , for a boozy &#34;float&#34;  Yum! Pricy too- and you can replicate the experience at home, with ease.",5

B01D4B2EF0,"on July 30, 2016",A3JEH3NECE55AB,Id say one of the best mixers for your jack,Well when I first herd of this product I thought it was just another gimmick soda from Pepsi. However I was mistaken. 1893 has just the right taste for the Pepsi fanatic. This is a much stronger Soda flavor. Id say one of the best mixers for your jack. Even better with a burger and frys. Look this is not your thirst quencher pepsi. This is a Pepsi you sit back and enjoy in a glass with ice.,5
