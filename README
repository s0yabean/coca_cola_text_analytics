Coca-Cola Text Analytics Project

This was a school project to analyse Coca-Colaâ€™s text analytics on twitter and youtube to conduct descriptive analytics on its campaign, TasteTheFeeling. 

We then provided recommendations for Coca-Cola to improve its competitive position in the Singapore market.

We recommend Coca-Cola to concentrate on familial themes in marketing campaigns, offer smaller serving of carbonated soft drinks and create customisable cans and bottles to better engage customers.

We presented our data with word clouds, sentiment graphs to identify emotions and customer sentiment through analysis on Coca-Cola and their competitors like Pepsi and Zevia.
